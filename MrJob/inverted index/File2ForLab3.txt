38	Chapter 1
39	
40	
41	It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
42	of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
43	
44	However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
45	first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
46	of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
47	of some one or other of their daughters.
48	
49	“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
50	Netherfield Park is let at last?”
51	
52	Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
53	
54	“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
55	told me all about it.”
56	
57	Mr. Bennet made no answer.
58	
59	“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.
60	
61	“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
62	
63	This was invitation enough.
64	
65	“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
66	by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
67	down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
68	delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
69	is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
70	be in the house by the end of next week.”
71	
72	“What is his name?”
73	
74	“Bingley.”
75	
76	“Is he married or single?”
77	
78	“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
79	five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”
80	
81	“How so? How can it affect them?”
82	
83	“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You
84	must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”
85	
86	“Is that his design in settling here?”
87	
88	“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
89	may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
90	soon as he comes.”
91	
92	“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
93	them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
94	as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
95	party.”
96	
97	“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but
98	I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
99	grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”
100	
101	“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”
102	
103	“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
104	the neighbourhood.”
105	
106	“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”
107	
108	“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
109	be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
110	go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
111	newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to
112	visit him if you do not.”
113	
114	“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
115	glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
116	hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though
117	I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”
118	
119	“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
120	others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
121	good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.”
122	
123	“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are
124	all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
125	quickness than her sisters.”
126	
127	“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You
128	take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”
129	
130	“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
131	are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
132	these last twenty years at least.”
133	
134	“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”
135	
136	“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
137	thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”
138	
139	“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
140	visit them.”
141	
142	“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
143	all.”
144	
145	Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
146	reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
147	been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind
148	was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
149	little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
150	she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
151	daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
152	
153	
154	
155	Chapter 2
156	
157	
158	Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
159	had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
160	his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
161	paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
162	manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
163	suddenly addressed her with:
164	
165	“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”
166	
167	“We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother
168	resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
169	
170	“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
171	assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”
172	
173	“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
174	of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
175	of her.”
176	
177	“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do
178	not depend on her serving you.”
179	
180	Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
181	herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
182	
183	“Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little
184	compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”
185	
186	“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
187	them ill.”
188	
189	“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is
190	your next ball to be, Lizzy?”
191	
192	“To-morrow fortnight.”
193	
194	“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back
195	till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
196	for she will not know him herself.”
197	
198	“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
199	Mr. Bingley to her.”
200	
201	“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
202	myself; how can you be so teasing?”
203	
204	“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
205	very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
206	fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
207	Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
208	she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
209	take it on myself.”
210	
211	The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
212	nonsense!”
213	
214	“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do
215	you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
216	them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you,
217	Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
218	great books and make extracts.”
219	
220	Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
221	
222	“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
223	Bingley.”
224	
225	“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.
226	
227	“I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If
228	I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
229	on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
230	cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
231	
232	The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
233	Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
234	was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
235	while.
236	
237	“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
238	persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
239	neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
240	good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
241	word about it till now.”
242	
243	“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
244	as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
245	
246	“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was
247	shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
248	or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
249	pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
250	for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are
251	the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
252	ball.”
253	
254	“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I am the
255	youngest, I'm the tallest.”
256	
257	The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
258	return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
259	dinner.
260	
261	
262	
263	Chapter 3
264	
265	
266	Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
267	daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
268	husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
269	in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
270	distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
271	last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
272	Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
273	delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
274	agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
275	with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
276	dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
277	hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.
278	
279	“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
280	 said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
281	married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”
282	
283	In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about
284	ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
285	admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
286	heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
287	fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
288	window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
289	
290	An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
291	had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
292	housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
293	was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
294	to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
295	disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
296	so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
297	he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
298	settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
299	a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
300	a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
301	was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
302	The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
303	day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
304	six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when
305	the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
306	altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
307	another young man.
308	
309	Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
310	countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
311	with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
312	looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
313	of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
314	the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
315	after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
316	pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
317	was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
318	admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
319	which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
320	proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
321	his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
322	forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
323	with his friend.
324	
325	Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
326	people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
327	was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
328	one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
329	themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
330	only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
331	introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
332	walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
333	His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
334	in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
335	Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
336	his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
337	having slighted one of her daughters.
338	
339	Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
340	down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
341	standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
342	Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
343	to join it.
344	
345	“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you
346	standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
347	dance.”
348	
349	“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
350	particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
351	it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
352	another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
353	stand up with.”
354	
355	“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a
356	kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
357	my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
358	uncommonly pretty.”
359	
360	“You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
361	Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
362	
363	“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
364	of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
365	dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”
366	
367	“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at
368	Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
369	“She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no
370	humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
371	by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
372	smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”
373	
374	Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
375	remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
376	however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
377	playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
378	
379	The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
380	Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
381	party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
382	distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
383	her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
384	pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
385	accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
386	fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
387	had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
388	spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
389	were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
390	a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
391	good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
392	such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on
393	the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
394	different story to hear.
395	
396	“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
397	delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
398	Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
399	she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
400	her twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her
401	twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
402	time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
403	up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
404	can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
405	down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
406	asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
407	and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
408	and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger--”
409	
410	“If he had had any compassion for me,” cried her husband impatiently,
411	“he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
412	his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”
413	
414	“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
415	handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
416	anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
417	Hurst's gown--”
418	
419	Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
420	description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
421	of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
422	exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
423	
424	“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
425	suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
426	all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
427	him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
428	great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
429	dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”
430	
431	
432	
433	Chapter 4
434	
435	
436	When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
437	her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
438	much she admired him.
439	
440	“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
441	good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
442	ease, with such perfect good breeding!”
443	
444	“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
445	likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”
446	
447	“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
448	did not expect such a compliment.”
449	
450	“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
451	us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What
452	could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
453	seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
454	in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
455	very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
456	stupider person.”
457	
458	“Dear Lizzy!”
459	
460	“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
461	You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
462	in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
463	life.”
464	
465	“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
466	what I think.”
467	
468	“I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your
469	good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
470	others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
471	everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the
472	good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing
473	of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,
474	too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”
475	
476	“Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
477	converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
478	his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
479	neighbour in her.”
480	
481	Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
482	the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
483	quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
484	and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
485	was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
486	ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
487	power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
488	conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
489	first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
490	pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
491	associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
492	entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
493	a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
494	impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their
495	own had been acquired by trade.
496	
497	Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
498	thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
499	estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
500	sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
501	good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
502	who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
503	remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
504	purchase.
505	
506	His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
507	though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
508	means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
509	married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
510	his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
511	age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
512	to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
513	half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
514	rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
515	immediately.
516	
517	Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
518	great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
519	easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
520	could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
521	never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley
522	had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
523	In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
524	deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
525	reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
526	inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
527	was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
528	giving offense.
529	
530	The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
531	characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
532	prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
533	to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
534	acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
535	conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
536	collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
537	none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
538	either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
539	but she smiled too much.
540	
541	Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
542	her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
543	whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
544	established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
545	commendation to think of her as he chose.
546	
547	
548	
549	Chapter 5
550	
551	
552	Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
553	were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
554	in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
555	honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
556	The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
557	disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;
558	and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
559	about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
560	where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
561	unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
562	the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
563	supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
564	nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
565	James's had made him courteous.
566	
567	Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
568	valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
569	of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
570	Elizabeth's intimate friend.
571	
572	That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
573	a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
574	brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
575	
576	“You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil
577	self-command to Miss Lucas. “You were Mr. Bingley's first choice.”
578	
579	“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”
580	
581	“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
582	sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
583	did--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
584	about Mr. Robinson.”
585	
586	“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
587	I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
588	assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
589	pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his
590	answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
591	beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'”
592	
593	“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as
594	if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”
595	
596	“My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said
597	Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
598	is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just tolerable.”
599	
600	“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
601	ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
602	a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
603	sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”
604	
605	“Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.
606	“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”
607	
608	“Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
609	could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
610	being spoke to.”
611	
612	“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,
613	unless among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably
614	agreeable.”
615	
616	“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
617	agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
618	was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
619	heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
620	the ball in a hack chaise.”
621	
622	“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I
623	wish he had danced with Eliza.”
624	
625	“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with him,
626	if I were you.”
627	
628	“I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.”
629	
630	“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend me so much as pride
631	often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
632	very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
633	should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right
634	to be proud.”
635	
636	“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive
637	his pride, if he had not mortified mine.”
638	
639	“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
640	reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
641	ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
642	nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
643	who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
644	quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
645	things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
646	be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
647	ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
648	
649	“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with
650	his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
651	foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”
652	
653	“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.
654	Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
655	directly.”
656	
657	The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
658	would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
659	
660	
661	
662	Chapter 6
663	
664	
665	The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
666	was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on
667	the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
668	found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
669	a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards
670	the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
671	pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
672	of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
673	though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
674	all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It
675	was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and
676	to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
677	which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
678	way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
679	was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
680	united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
681	uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
682	of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.
683	
684	“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
685	on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
686	so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
687	from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
688	it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
689	the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
690	attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
691	begin freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
692	very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
693	encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show more
694	affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
695	may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”
696	
697	“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
698	perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
699	discover it too.”
700	
701	“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.”
702	
703	“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
704	it, he must find it out.”
705	
706	“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
707	meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
708	always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
709	every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
710	therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his
711	attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for
712	falling in love as much as she chooses.”
713	
714	“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
715	question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
716	to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
717	these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
718	she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
719	reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
720	dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
721	and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
722	enough to make her understand his character.”
723	
724	“Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might
725	only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
726	remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four
727	evenings may do a great deal.”
728	
729	“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
730	both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
731	leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”
732	
733	“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and
734	if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
735	chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
736	twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
737	the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
738	ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
739	least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
740	have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
741	possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
742	life.”
743	
744	“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
745	sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
746	
747	Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
748	was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
749	interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
750	allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
751	ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
752	sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
753	had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
754	uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
755	this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
756	detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
757	in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
758	pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
759	of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
760	this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made
761	himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
762	to dance with.
763	
764	He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
765	with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
766	drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
767	assembled.
768	
769	“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
770	conversation with Colonel Forster?”
771	
772	“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”
773	
774	“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
775	what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
776	being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”
777	
778	On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
779	any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
780	a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
781	turned to him and said:
782	
783	“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
784	well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
785	Meryton?”
786	
787	“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
788	energetic.”
789	
790	“You are severe on us.”
791	
792	“It will be her turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going
793	to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”
794	
795	“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
796	to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
797	a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
798	really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
799	hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
800	she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing
801	at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
802	course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I
803	shall keep mine to swell my song.”
804	
805	Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
806	or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
807	she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
808	sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
809	the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
810	impatient for display.
811	
812	Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
813	application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
814	manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
815	had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
816	much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
817	end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
818	Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
819	with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
820	dancing at one end of the room.
821	
822	Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
823	passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
824	much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
825	his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:
826	
827	“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
828	is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
829	refinements of polished society.”
830	
831	“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
832	the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.”
833	
834	Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
835	continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
836	not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”
837	
838	“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”
839	
840	“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
841	you often dance at St. James's?”
842	
843	“Never, sir.”
844	
845	“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”
846	
847	“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”
848	
849	“You have a house in town, I conclude?”
850	
851	Mr. Darcy bowed.
852	
853	“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond
854	of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
855	London would agree with Lady Lucas.”
856	
857	He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed
858	to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
859	struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
860	her:
861	
862	“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
863	me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
864	cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.”
865	 And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
866	extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
867	drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:
868	
869	“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
870	not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”
871	
872	Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
873	her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
874	all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
875	
876	“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
877	me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
878	amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
879	for one half-hour.”
880	
881	“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.
882	
883	“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
884	we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a
885	partner?”
886	
887	Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
888	injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
889	complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:
890	
891	“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”
892	
893	“I should imagine not.”
894	
895	“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
896	in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
897	I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the
898	nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would
899	I give to hear your strictures on them!”
900	
901	“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
902	agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
903	which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”
904	
905	Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
906	would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
907	Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:
908	
909	“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”
910	
911	“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.
912	How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you
913	joy?”
914	
915	“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
916	imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
917	to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”
918	
919	“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
920	absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
921	and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”
922	
923	He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
924	entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
925	that all was safe, her wit flowed long.
926	
927	
928	
929	Chapter 7
930	
931	
932	Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
933	thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
934	in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
935	fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
936	the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
937	had left her four thousand pounds.
938	
939	She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
940	their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
941	London in a respectable line of trade.
942	
943	The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
944	convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
945	thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
946	to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
947	Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
948	their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
949	better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
950	hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
951	the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
952	from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
953	news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
954	neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
955	headquarters.
956	
957	Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
958	interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
959	of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
960	secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
961	Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
962	felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
963	Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
964	to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
965	regimentals of an ensign.
966	
967	After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
968	Bennet coolly observed:
969	
970	“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
971	of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
972	I am now convinced.”
973	
974	Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
975	indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
976	and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
977	next morning to London.
978	
979	“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
980	ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
981	of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.”
982	
983	“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”
984	
985	“Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”
986	
987	“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
988	had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
989	so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
990	foolish.”
991	
992	“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
993	their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
994	not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when
995	I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
996	heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
997	should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
998	Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in
999	his regimentals.”
1000	
1001	“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
1002	Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
1003	came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.”
1004	
1005	Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
1006	a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
1007	for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
1008	eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
1009	
1010	“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
1011	Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”
1012	
1013	“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.
1014	
1015	“MY DEAR FRIEND,--
1016	
1017	“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
1018	we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
1019	for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
1020	quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
1021	gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,
1022	
1023	“CAROLINE BINGLEY”
1024	
1025	“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
1026	that.”
1027	
1028	“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”
1029	
1030	“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.
1031	
1032	“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
1033	rain; and then you must stay all night.”
1034	
1035	“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
1036	they would not offer to send her home.”
1037	
1038	“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,
1039	and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”
1040	
1041	“I had much rather go in the coach.”
1042	
1043	“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
1044	wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”
1045	
1046	“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”
1047	
1048	“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother's purpose
1049	will be answered.”
1050	
1051	She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
1052	were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
1053	mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
1054	bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before
1055	it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
1056	delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
1057	Jane certainly could not come back.
1058	
1059	“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than
1060	once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
1061	next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
1062	contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
1063	brought the following note for Elizabeth:
1064	
1065	“MY DEAREST LIZZY,--
1066	
1067	“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
1068	imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
1069	hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
1070	Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
1071	to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
1072	matter with me.--Yours, etc.”
1073	
1074	“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
1075	aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
1076	should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
1077	Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”
1078	
1079	“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
1080	colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
1081	all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”
1082	
1083	Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
1084	the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking
1085	was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
1086	
1087	“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
1088	thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
1089	there.”
1090	
1091	“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”
1092	
1093	“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
1094	horses?”
1095	
1096	“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
1097	when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”
1098	
1099	“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
1100	impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
1101	exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”
1102	
1103	“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
1104	Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
1105	together.
1106	
1107	“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
1108	see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”
1109	
1110	In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
1111	of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
1112	field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
1113	over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
1114	within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
1115	glowing with the warmth of exercise.
1116	
1117	She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
1118	assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
1119	That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
1120	dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
1121	Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
1122	for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
1123	brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there
1124	was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
1125	Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
1126	brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as
1127	to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
1128	thinking only of his breakfast.
1129	
1130	Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
1131	Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
1132	well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
1133	immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
1134	alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
1135	for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
1136	however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
1137	together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
1138	extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
1139	her.
1140	
1141	When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
1142	began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
1143	solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
1144	examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
1145	a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
1146	advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
1147	was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
1148	ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were
1149	the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in
1150	fact, nothing to do elsewhere.
1151	
1152	When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
1153	unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
1154	wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
1155	in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
1156	of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
1157	Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
1158	Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
1159	of clothes.
1160	
1161	
1162	
1163	Chapter 8
1164	
1165	
1166	At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
1167	Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
1168	poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
1169	much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very
1170	favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
1171	this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
1172	shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
1173	being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
1174	indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
1175	Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.
1176	
1177	Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
1178	regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
1179	attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
1180	herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
1181	others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
1182	engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
1183	Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
1184	eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain
1185	dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
1186	
1187	When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
1188	began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
1189	pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
1190	she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
1191	same, and added:
1192	
1193	“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
1194	walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
1195	looked almost wild.”
1196	
1197	“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
1198	nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the
1199	country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”
1200	
1201	“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
1202	in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
1203	hide it not doing its office.”
1204	
1205	“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
1206	all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
1207	well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
1208	escaped my notice.”
1209	
1210	“You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
1211	inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such
1212	an exhibition.”
1213	
1214	“Certainly not.”
1215	
1216	“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
1217	above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
1218	it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
1219	a most country-town indifference to decorum.”
1220	
1221	“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
1222	Bingley.
1223	
1224	“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that
1225	this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”
1226	
1227	“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
1228	short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:
1229	
1230	“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
1231	sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
1232	such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
1233	no chance of it.”
1234	
1235	“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
1236	Meryton.”
1237	
1238	“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”
1239	
1240	“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
1241	
1242	“If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
1243	would not make them one jot less agreeable.”
1244	
1245	“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
1246	consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.
1247	
1248	To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
1249	hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
1250	their dear friend's vulgar relations.
1251	
1252	With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
1253	leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
1254	She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
1255	late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and
1256	when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
1257	downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
1258	party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
1259	them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
1260	excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
1261	below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
1262	
1263	“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”
1264	
1265	“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great
1266	reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”
1267	
1268	“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am
1269	not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”
1270	
1271	“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and
1272	I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”
1273	
1274	Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the
1275	table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
1276	others--all that his library afforded.
1277	
1278	“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
1279	credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
1280	than I ever looked into.”
1281	
1282	Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
1283	in the room.
1284	
1285	“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left
1286	so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
1287	Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”
1288	
1289	“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many
1290	generations.”
1291	
1292	“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
1293	books.”
1294	
1295	“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
1296	these.”
1297	
1298	“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
1299	that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be
1300	half as delightful as Pemberley.”
1301	
1302	“I wish it may.”
1303	
1304	“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
1305	neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
1306	finer county in England than Derbyshire.”
1307	
1308	“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”
1309	
1310	“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”
1311	
1312	“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
1313	Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”
1314	
1315	Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
1316	little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew
1317	near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his
1318	eldest sister, to observe the game.
1319	
1320	“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will
1321	she be as tall as I am?”
1322	
1323	“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
1324	rather taller.”
1325	
1326	“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
1327	so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
1328	for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”
1329	
1330	“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
1331	to be so very accomplished as they all are.”
1332	
1333	“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”
1334	
1335	“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
1336	net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure
1337	I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
1338	informed that she was very accomplished.”
1339	
1340	“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
1341	too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
1342	otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
1343	far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
1344	cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
1345	acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”
1346	
1347	“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.
1348	
1349	“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
1350	idea of an accomplished woman.”
1351	
1352	“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”
1353	
1354	“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
1355	esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
1356	with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
1357	dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
1358	all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
1359	walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
1360	will be but half-deserved.”
1361	
1362	“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must
1363	yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
1364	extensive reading.”
1365	
1366	“I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.
1367	I rather wonder now at your knowing any.”
1368	
1369	“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
1370	this?”
1371	
1372	“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
1373	application, and elegance, as you describe united.”
1374	
1375	Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
1376	implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
1377	answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
1378	bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
1379	conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
1380	room.
1381	
1382	“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
1383	“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
1384	other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
1385	succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”
1386	
1387	“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
1388	“there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
1389	to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
1390	despicable.”
1391	
1392	Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
1393	continue the subject.

1401	that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
1402	were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
1403	declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
1404	however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
1405	to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
1406	attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
