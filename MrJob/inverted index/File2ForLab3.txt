47 INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.
48 
49 The Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the exception
50 of the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them. There are nearer
51 approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist; the
52 Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of
53 the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the
54 Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other
55 Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection
56 of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains
57 more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not of one age
58 only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony or a greater
59 wealth of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. Nor in any other of
60 his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and speculation, or
61 to connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is the centre around
62 which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches the
63 highest point (cp, especially in Books V, VI, VII) to which ancient
64 thinkers ever attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the
65 moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although
66 neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from
67 the substance of truth; and both of them had to be content with an
68 abstraction of science which was not yet realized. He was the greatest
69 metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in
70 any other ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained.
71 The sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many
72 instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses
73 of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition, the law of
74 contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction
75 between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means
76 and ends, between causes and conditions; also the division of the mind
77 into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures
78 and desires into necessary and unnecessary--these and other great
79 forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and were
80 probably first invented by Plato. The greatest of all logical truths,
81 and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight,
82 the difference between words and things, has been most strenuously
83 insisted on by him (cp. Rep.; Polit.; Cratyl. 435, 436 ff), although he
84 has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings (e.g.
85 Rep.). But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae,--logic is
86 still veiled in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines to
87 'contemplate all truth and all existence' is very unlike the doctrine of
88 the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered (Soph. Elenchi,
89 33. 18).
90 
91 Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a
92 still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of
93 Athens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. The fragment of
94 the Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in
95 importance to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said as
96 a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth
97 century. This mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the
98 wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis, is supposed to be
99 founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to which it would have stood
100 in the same relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems of
101 Homer. It would have told of a struggle for Liberty (cp. Tim. 25 C), intended
102 to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. We may judge from the
103 noble commencement of the Timaeus, from the fragment of the Critias
104 itself, and from the third book of the Laws, in what manner Plato would
105 have treated this high argument. We can only guess why the great design
106 was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became sensible of some incongruity
107 in a fictitious history, or because he had lost his interest in it, or
108 because advancing years forbade the completion of it; and we may please
109 ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative ever been
110 finished, we should have found Plato himself sympathising with the
111 struggle for Hellenic independence (cp. Laws  iii. 698 ff.), singing a
112 hymn of triumph over Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection
113 of Herodotus (v. 78) where he contemplates the growth of the Athenian
114 empire--'How brave a thing is freedom of speech, which has made the
115 Athenians so far exceed every other state of Hellas in greatness!' or,
116 more probably, attributing the victory to the ancient good order of
117 Athens and to the favor of Apollo and Athene (cp. Introd. to Critias).
118 
119 Again, Plato may be regarded as the 'captain' ('arhchegoz') or leader
120 of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the
121 original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. Augustine's City of God,
122 of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary
123 States which are framed upon the same model. The extent to which
124 Aristotle or the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the
125 Politics has been little recognised, and the recognition is the
126 more necessary because it is not made by Aristotle himself. The two
127 philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and
128 probably some elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle. In
129 English philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the
130 works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in great original writers like
131 Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. That there is a truth
132 higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to herself, is
133 a conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically
134 asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek authors who at the
135 Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato has had the greatest
136 influence. The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon
137 education, of which the writings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean
138 Paul, and Goethe are the legitimate descendants. Like Dante or Bunyan,
139 he has a revelation of another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly
140 impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early Church he exercised
141 a real influence on theology, and at the Revival of Literature on
142 politics. Even the fragments of his words when 'repeated at second-hand'
143 (Symp. 215 D) have in all ages ravished the hearts of men, who have seen
144 reflected in them their own higher nature. He is the father of idealism
145 in philosophy, in politics, in literature. And many of the latest
146 conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of
147 knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have been
148 anticipated in a dream by him.
149 
150 The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature
151 of which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old
152 man--then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and
153 Polemarchus--then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained
154 by Socrates--reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and
155 having become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the
156 ideal State which is constructed by Socrates. The first care of the
157 rulers is to be education, of which an outline is drawn after the old
158 Hellenic model, providing only for an improved religion and morality,
159 and more simplicity in music and gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry,
160 and greater harmony of the individual and the State. We are thus led on
161 to the conception of a higher State, in which 'no man calls anything his
162 own,' and in which there is neither 'marrying nor giving in marriage,'
163 and 'kings are philosophers' and 'philosophers are kings;' and there
164 is another and higher education, intellectual as well as moral and
165 religious, of science as well as of art, and not of youth only but of
166 the whole of life. Such a State is hardly to be realized in this world
167 and quickly degenerates. To the perfect ideal succeeds the government
168 of the soldier and the lover of honour, this again declining into
169 democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but regular order
170 having not much resemblance to the actual facts. When 'the wheel has
171 come full circle' we do not begin again with a new period of human life;
172 but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end. The
173 subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy
174 which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the Republic
175 is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. Poetry is discovered to
176 be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and Homer, as well as
177 the dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is sent into
178 banishment along with them. And the idea of the State is supplemented by
179 the revelation of a future life.
180 
181 The division into books, like all similar divisions (Cp. Sir G.C. Lewis
182 in the Classical Museum, vol. ii. p 1.), is probably later than the age of Plato. The
183 natural divisions are five in number;--(1) Book I and the first half
184 of Book II down to the paragraph beginning, 'I had always admired the
185 genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus,' which is introductory; the first
186 book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions of
187 justice, and concluding, like some of the earlier Dialogues, without
188 arriving at any definite result. To this is appended a restatement of
189 the nature of justice according to common opinion, and an answer is
190 demanded to the question--What is justice, stripped of appearances? The
191 second division (2) includes the remainder of the second and the whole
192 of the third and fourth books, which are mainly occupied with the
193 construction of the first State and the first education. The third
194 division (3) consists of the fifth, sixth, and seventh books, in which
195 philosophy rather than justice is the subject of enquiry, and the
196 second State is constructed on principles of communism and ruled by
197 philosophers, and the contemplation of the idea of good takes the place
198 of the social and political virtues. In the eighth and ninth books (4)
199 the perversions of States and of the individuals who correspond to them
200 are reviewed in succession; and the nature of pleasure and the principle
201 of tyranny are further analysed in the individual man. The tenth book
202 (5) is the conclusion of the whole, in which the relations of philosophy
203 to poetry are finally determined, and the happiness of the citizens
204 in this life, which has now been assured, is crowned by the vision of
205 another.
206 
207 Or a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first
208 (Books I - IV) containing the description of a State framed generally in
209 accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality, while in the
210 second (Books V - X) the Hellenic State is transformed into an
211 ideal kingdom of philosophy, of which all other governments are the
212 perversions. These two points of view are really opposed, and the
213 opposition is only veiled by the genius of Plato. The Republic, like
214 the Phaedrus (see Introduction to Phaedrus), is an imperfect whole; the
215 higher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the
216 Hellenic temple, which at last fades away into the heavens. Whether this
217 imperfection of structure arises from an enlargement of the plan;
218 or from the imperfect reconcilement in the writer's own mind of the
219 struggling elements of thought which are now first brought together
220 by him; or, perhaps, from the composition of the work at different
221 times--are questions, like the similar question about the Iliad and
222 the Odyssey, which are worth asking, but which cannot have a distinct
223 answer. In the age of Plato there was no regular mode of publication,
224 and an author would have the less scruple in altering or adding to a
225 work which was known only to a few of his friends. There is no absurdity
226 in supposing that he may have laid his labours aside for a time, or
227 turned from one work to another; and such interruptions would be more
228 likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short writing. In all
229 attempts to determine the chronological order of the Platonic writings
230 on internal evidence, this uncertainty about any single Dialogue being
231 composed at one time is a disturbing element, which must be admitted
232 to affect longer works, such as the Republic and the Laws, more than
233 shorter ones. But, on the other hand, the seeming discrepancies of
234 the Republic may only arise out of the discordant elements which the
235 philosopher has attempted to unite in a single whole, perhaps without
236 being himself able to recognise the inconsistency which is obvious to
237 us. For there is a judgment of after ages which few great writers have
238 ever been able to anticipate for themselves. They do not perceive the
239 want of connexion in their own writings, or the gaps in their systems
240 which are visible enough to those who come after them. In the beginnings
241 of literature and philosophy, amid the first efforts of thought and
242 language, more inconsistencies occur than now, when the paths of
243 speculation are well worn and the meaning of words precisely defined.
244 For consistency, too, is the growth of time; and some of the greatest
245 creations of the human mind have been wanting in unity. Tried by this
246 test, several of the Platonic Dialogues, according to our modern ideas,
247 appear to be defective, but the deficiency is no proof that they were
248 composed at different times or by different hands. And the supposition
249 that the Republic was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort
250 is in some degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of
251 the work to another.
252 
253 The second title, 'Concerning Justice,' is not the one by which the
254 Republic is quoted, either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity, and,
255 like the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues, may therefore be
256 assumed to be of later date. Morgenstern and others have asked
257 whether the definition of justice, which is the professed aim, or the
258 construction of the State is the principal argument of the work. The
259 answer is, that the two blend in one, and are two faces of the same
260 truth; for justice is the order of the State, and the State is the
261 visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society. The
262 one is the soul and the other is the body, and the Greek ideal of the
263 State, as of the individual, is a fair mind in a fair body. In Hegelian
264 phraseology the state is the reality of which justice is the idea. Or,
265 described in Christian language, the kingdom of God is within, and yet
266 developes into a Church or external kingdom; 'the house not made with
267 hands, eternal in the heavens,' is reduced to the proportions of an
268 earthly building. Or, to use a Platonic image, justice and the State are
269 the warp and the woof which run through the whole texture. And when the
270 constitution of the State is completed, the conception of justice is not
271 dismissed, but reappears under the same or different names throughout
272 the work, both as the inner law of the individual soul, and finally as
273 the principle of rewards and punishments in another life. The virtues
274 are based on justice, of which common honesty in buying and selling
275 is the shadow, and justice is based on the idea of good, which is the
276 harmony of the world, and is reflected both in the institutions of
277 states and in motions of the heavenly bodies (cp. Tim. 47). The Timaeus,
278 which takes up the political rather than the ethical side of the
279 Republic, and is chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward
280 world, yet contains many indications that the same law is supposed to
281 reign over the State, over nature, and over man.
282 
283 Too much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient and
284 modern times. There is a stage of criticism in which all works, whether
285 of nature or of art, are referred to design. Now in ancient writings,
286 and indeed in literature generally, there remains often a large element
287 which was not comprehended in the original design. For the plan grows
288 under the author's hand; new thoughts occur to him in the act of
289 writing; he has not worked out the argument to the end before he begins.
290 The reader who seeks to find some one idea under which the whole may be
291 conceived, must necessarily seize on the vaguest and most general. Thus
292 Stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with the ordinary explanations of the
293 argument of the Republic, imagines himself to have found the true
294 argument 'in the representation of human life in a State perfected by
295 justice, and governed according to the idea of good.' There may be some
296 use in such general descriptions, but they can hardly be said to express
297 the design of the writer. The truth is, that we may as well speak of
298 many designs as of one; nor need anything be excluded from the plan of
299 a great work to which the mind is naturally led by the association of
300 ideas, and which does not interfere with the general purpose. What kind
301 or degree of unity is to be sought after in a building, in the plastic
302 arts, in poetry, in prose, is a problem which has to be determined
303 relatively to the subject-matter. To Plato himself, the enquiry 'what
304 was the intention of the writer,' or 'what was the principal argument
305 of the Republic' would have been hardly intelligible, and therefore had
306 better be at once dismissed (cp. the Introduction to the Phaedrus).
307 
308 Is not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which,
309 to Plato's own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of the
310 State? Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah, or 'the day
311 of the Lord,' or the suffering Servant or people of God, or the 'Sun of
312 righteousness with healing in his wings' only convey, to us at least,
313 their great spiritual ideals, so through the Greek State Plato reveals
314 to us his own thoughts about divine perfection, which is the idea of
315 good--like the sun in the visible world;--about human perfection, which
316 is justice--about education beginning in youth and continuing in later
317 years--about poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false teachers
318 and evil rulers of mankind--about 'the world' which is the embodiment of
319 them--about a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth but is laid up
320 in heaven to be the pattern and rule of human life. No such inspired
321 creation is at unity with itself, any more than the clouds of heaven
322 when the sun pierces through them. Every shade of light and dark, of
323 truth, and of fiction which is the veil of truth, is allowable in a work
324 of philosophical imagination. It is not all on the same plane; it easily
325 passes from ideas to myths and fancies, from facts to figures of speech.
326 It is not prose but poetry, at least a great part of it, and ought not
327 to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of history. The
328 writer is not fashioning his ideas into an artistic whole; they take
329 possession of him and are too much for him. We have no need therefore
330 to discuss whether a State such as Plato has conceived is practicable or
331 not, or whether the outward form or the inward life came first into the
332 mind of the writer. For the practicability of his ideas has nothing to
333 do with their truth; and the highest thoughts to which he attains may be
334 truly said to bear the greatest 'marks of design'--justice more than the
335 external frame-work of the State, the idea of good more than justice.
336 The great science of dialectic or the organisation of ideas has no real
337 content; but is only a type of the method or spirit in which the
338 higher knowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and
339 all existence. It is in the fifth, sixth, and seventh books that Plato
340 reaches the 'summit of speculation,' and these, although they fail to
341 satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker, may therefore be regarded
342 as the most important, as they are also the most original, portions of
343 the work.
344 
345 It is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has
346 been raised by Boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the
347 conversation was held (the year 411 B.C. which is proposed by him will
348 do as well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a
349 writer who, like Plato, is notoriously careless of chronology (cp. Rep.,
350 Symp., 193 A, etc.), only aims at general probability. Whether all the persons
351 mentioned in the Republic could ever have met at any one time is not
352 a difficulty which would have occurred to an Athenian reading the work
353 forty years later, or to Plato himself at the time of writing (any more
354 than to Shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas); and need not
355 greatly trouble us now. Yet this may be a question having no answer
356 'which is still worth asking,' because the investigation shows that we
357 cannot argue historically from the dates in Plato; it would be useless
358 therefore to waste time in inventing far-fetched reconcilements of them
359 in order to avoid chronological difficulties, such, for example, as
360 the conjecture of C.F. Hermann, that Glaucon and Adeimantus are not the
361 brothers but the uncles of Plato (cp. Apol. 34 A), or the fancy of Stallbaum
362 that Plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at which
363 some of his Dialogues were written.
364 
365 The principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus, Polemarchus,
366 Thrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Cephalus appears in the
367 introduction only, Polemarchus drops at the end of the first argument,
368 and Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the first book.
369 The main discussion is carried on by Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus.
370 Among the company are Lysias (the orator) and Euthydemus, the sons of
371 Cephalus and brothers of Polemarchus, an unknown Charmantides--these are
372 mute auditors; also there is Cleitophon, who once interrupts, where, as
373 in the Dialogue which bears his name, he appears as the friend and ally
374 of Thrasymachus.
375 
376 Cephalus, the patriarch of the house, has been appropriately engaged
377 in offering a sacrifice. He is the pattern of an old man who has almost
378 done with life, and is at peace with himself and with all mankind. He
379 feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below, and seems to linger
380 around the memory of the past. He is eager that Socrates should come
381 to visit him, fond of the poetry of the last generation, happy in the
382 consciousness of a well-spent life, glad at having escaped from the
383 tyranny of youthful lusts. His love of conversation, his affection, his
384 indifference to riches, even his garrulity, are interesting traits of
385 character. He is not one of those who have nothing to say, because their
386 whole mind has been absorbed in making money. Yet he acknowledges
387 that riches have the advantage of placing men above the temptation
388 to dishonesty or falsehood. The respectful attention shown to him by
389 Socrates, whose love of conversation, no less than the mission imposed
390 upon him by the Oracle, leads him to ask questions of all men, young and
391 old alike, should also be noted. Who better suited to raise the question
392 of justice than Cephalus, whose life might seem to be the expression of
393 it? The moderation with which old age is pictured by Cephalus as a very
394 tolerable portion of existence is characteristic, not only of him,
395 but of Greek feeling generally, and contrasts with the exaggeration of
396 Cicero in the De Senectute. The evening of life is described by Plato
397 in the most expressive manner, yet with the fewest possible touches. As
398 Cicero remarks (Ep. ad Attic. iv. 16), the aged Cephalus would have been out of
399 place in the discussion which follows, and which he could neither have
400 understood nor taken part in without a violation of dramatic propriety
401 (cp. Lysimachus in the Laches).
402 
403 His 'son and heir' Polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness of
404 youth; he is for detaining Socrates by force in the opening scene,
405 and will not 'let him off' on the subject of women and children.
406 Like Cephalus, he is limited in his point of view, and represents
407 the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather than
408 principles; and he quotes Simonides (cp. Aristoph. Clouds) as his father
409 had quoted Pindar. But after this he has no more to say; the answers
410 which he makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of Socrates.
411 He has not yet experienced the influence of the Sophists like Glaucon
412 and Adeimantus, nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them; he
413 belongs to the pre-Socratic or pre-dialectical age. He is incapable of
414 arguing, and is bewildered by Socrates to such a degree that he does not
415 know what he is saying. He is made to admit that justice is a thief, and
416 that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts. From his brother Lysias
417 (contra Eratosth.) we learn that he fell a victim to the Thirty Tyrants,
418 but no allusion is here made to his fate, nor to the circumstance that
419 Cephalus and his family were of Syracusan origin, and had migrated from
420 Thurii to Athens.
421 
422 The 'Chalcedonian giant,' Thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard
423 in the Phaedrus, is the personification of the Sophists, according to
424 Plato's conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics. He
425 is vain and blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid, fond of
426 making an oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable Socrates;
427 but a mere child in argument, and unable to foresee that the next 'move'
428 (to use a Platonic expression) will 'shut him up.' He has reached the
429 stage of framing general notions, and in this respect is in advance of
430 Cephalus and Polemarchus. But he is incapable of defending them in a
431 discussion, and vainly tries to cover his confusion with banter and
432 insolence. Whether such doctrines as are attributed to him by Plato were
433 really held either by him or by any other Sophist is uncertain; in the
434 infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easily grow
435 up--they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers in Thucydides;
436 but we are concerned at present with Plato's description of him, and not
437 with the historical reality. The inequality of the contest adds greatly
438 to the humour of the scene. The pompous and empty Sophist is utterly
439 helpless in the hands of the great master of dialectic, who knows how
440 to touch all the springs of vanity and weakness in him. He is greatly
441 irritated by the irony of Socrates, but his noisy and imbecile rage
442 only lays him more and more open to the thrusts of his assailant. His
443 determination to cram down their throats, or put 'bodily into their
444 souls' his own words, elicits a cry of horror from Socrates. The
445 state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as the process of the
446 argument. Nothing is more amusing than his complete submission when
447 he has been once thoroughly beaten. At first he seems to continue the
448 discussion with reluctance, but soon with apparent good-will, and he
449 even testifies his interest at a later stage by one or two occasional
450 remarks. When attacked by Glaucon he is humorously protected by Socrates
451 'as one who has never been his enemy and is now his friend.' From Cicero
452 and Quintilian and from Aristotle's Rhetoric we learn that the Sophist
453 whom Plato has made so ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were
454 preserved in later ages. The play on his name which was made by his
455 contemporary Herodicus (Aris. Rhet.), 'thou wast ever bold in
456 battle,' seems to show that the description of him is not devoid of
457 verisimilitude.
458 
459 When Thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal respondents,
460 Glaucon and Adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, as in Greek tragedy
461 (cp. Introd. to Phaedo), three actors are introduced. At first sight
462 the two sons of Ariston may seem to wear a family likeness, like the two
463 friends Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo. But on a nearer examination
464 of them the similarity vanishes, and they are seen to be distinct
465 characters. Glaucon is the impetuous youth who can 'just never have
466 enough of fechting' (cp. the character of him in Xen. Mem. iii. 6);
467 the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of love; the
468 'juvenis qui gaudet canibus,' and who improves the breed of animals; the
469 lover of art and music who has all the experiences of youthful life. He
470 is full of quickness and penetration, piercing easily below the clumsy
471 platitudes of Thrasymachus to the real difficulty; he turns out to the
472 light the seamy side of human life, and yet does not lose faith in the
473 just and true. It is Glaucon who seizes what may be termed the ludicrous
474 relation of the philosopher to the world, to whom a state of simplicity
475 is 'a city of pigs,' who is always prepared with a jest when the
476 argument offers him an opportunity, and who is ever ready to second
477 the humour of Socrates and to appreciate the ridiculous, whether in
478 the connoisseurs of music, or in the lovers of theatricals, or in the
479 fantastic behaviour of the citizens of democracy. His weaknesses are
480 several times alluded to by Socrates, who, however, will not allow him
481 to be attacked by his brother Adeimantus. He is a soldier, and, like
482 Adeimantus, has been distinguished at the battle of Megara (anno
483 456?)...The character of Adeimantus is deeper and graver, and the
484 profounder objections are commonly put into his mouth. Glaucon is more
485 demonstrative, and generally opens the game. Adeimantus pursues the
486 argument further. Glaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy
487 of youth; Adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grown-up man of
488 the world. In the second book, when Glaucon insists that justice and
489 injustice shall be considered without regard to their consequences,
490 Adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankind in general only for
491 the sake of their consequences; and in a similar vein of reflection he
492 urges at the beginning of the fourth book that Socrates fails in making
493 his citizens happy, and is answered that happiness is not the first but
494 the second thing, not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of
495 the good government of a State. In the discussion about religion and
496 mythology, Adeimantus is the respondent, but Glaucon breaks in with a
497 slight jest, and carries on the conversation in a lighter tone about
498 music and gymnastic to the end of the book. It is Adeimantus again
499 who volunteers the criticism of common sense on the Socratic method of
500 argument, and who refuses to let Socrates pass lightly over the question
501 of women and children. It is Adeimantus who is the respondent in the
502 more argumentative, as Glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative
503 portions of the Dialogue. For example, throughout the greater part
504 of the sixth book, the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the
505 conception of the idea of good are discussed with Adeimantus. Glaucon
506 resumes his place of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty in
507 apprehending the higher education of Socrates, and makes some false hits
508 in the course of the discussion. Once more Adeimantus returns with the
509 allusion to his brother Glaucon whom he compares to the contentious
510 State; in the next book he is again superseded, and Glaucon continues to
511 the end.
512 
513 Thus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successive
514 stages of morality, beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the olden
515 time, who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his
516 life by proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization of
517 the Sophists, and lastly come the young disciples of the great teacher,
518 who know the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced by them,
519 and desire to go deeper into the nature of things. These too, like
520 Cephalus, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, are clearly distinguished from one
521 another. Neither in the Republic, nor in any other Dialogue of Plato, is
522 a single character repeated.
523 
524 The delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not wholly consistent. In
525 the first book we have more of the real Socrates, such as he is depicted
526 in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, in the earliest Dialogues of Plato, and
527 in the Apology. He is ironical, provoking, questioning, the old enemy
528 of the Sophists, ready to put on the mask of Silenus as well as to argue
529 seriously. But in the sixth book his enmity towards the Sophists abates;
530 he acknowledges that they are the representatives rather than the
531 corrupters of the world. He also becomes more dogmatic and constructive,
532 passing beyond the range either of the political or the speculative
533 ideas of the real Socrates. In one passage Plato himself seems to
534 intimate that the time had now come for Socrates, who had passed his
535 whole life in philosophy, to give his own opinion and not to be always
536 repeating the notions of other men. There is no evidence that either the
537 idea of good or the conception of a perfect state were comprehended in
538 the Socratic teaching, though he certainly dwelt on the nature of
539 the universal and of final causes (cp. Xen. Mem.; Phaedo); and a deep
540 thinker like him, in his thirty or forty years of public teaching, could
541 hardly have failed to touch on the nature of family relations, for
542 which there is also some positive evidence in the Memorabilia (Mem.) The
543 Socratic method is nominally retained; and every inference is either put
544 into the mouth of the respondent or represented as the common discovery
545 of him and Socrates. But any one can see that this is a mere form, of
546 which the affectation grows wearisome as the work advances. The method
547 of enquiry has passed into a method of teaching in which by the help of
548 interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various points of view.
549 The nature of the process is truly characterized by Glaucon, when
550 he describes himself as a companion who is not good for much in an
551 investigation, but can see what he is shown, and may, perhaps, give the
552 answer to a question more fluently than another.
553 
554 Neither can we be absolutely certain that Socrates himself taught the
555 immortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple Glaucon in the
556 Republic (cp. Apol.); nor is there any reason to suppose that he used
557 myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction,
558 or that he would have banished poetry or have denounced the Greek
559 mythology. His favorite oath is retained, and a slight mention is made
560 of the daemonium, or internal sign, which is alluded to by Socrates as
561 a phenomenon peculiar to himself. A real element of Socratic teaching,
562 which is more prominent in the Republic than in any of the other
563 Dialogues of Plato, is the use of example and illustration (Greek):
564 'Let us apply the test of common instances.' 'You,' says Adeimantus,
565 ironically, in the sixth book, 'are so unaccustomed to speak in images.'
566 And this use of examples or images, though truly Socratic in origin, is
567 enlarged by the genius of Plato into the form of an allegory or parable,
568 which embodies in the concrete what has been already described, or is
569 about to be described, in the abstract. Thus the figure of the cave in
570 Book VII is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in Book VI.
571 The composite animal in Book IX is an allegory of the parts of the
572 soul. The noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in Book VI are
573 a figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in the
574 State which has been described. Other figures, such as the dog, or
575 the marriage of the portionless maiden, or the drones and wasps in the
576 eighth and ninth books, also form links of connexion in long passages,
577 or are used to recall previous discussions.
578 
579 Plato is most true to the character of his master when he describes him
580 as 'not of this world.' And with this representation of him the ideal
581 state and the other paradoxes of the Republic are quite in accordance,
582 though they cannot be shown to have been speculations of Socrates. To
583 him, as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious, when
584 they looked upward, the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and
585 evil. The common sense of mankind has revolted against this view, or
586 has only partially admitted it. And even in Socrates himself the sterner
587 judgement of the multitude at times passes into a sort of ironical pity
588 or love. Men in general are incapable of philosophy, and are therefore
589 at enmity with the philosopher; but their misunderstanding of him is
590 unavoidable: for they have never seen him as he truly is in his own
591 image; they are only acquainted with artificial systems possessing no
592 native force of truth--words which admit of many applications. Their
593 leaders have nothing to measure with, and are therefore ignorant of
594 their own stature. But they are to be pitied or laughed at, not to be
595 quarrelled with; they mean well with their nostrums, if they could only
596 learn that they are cutting off a Hydra's head. This moderation towards
597 those who are in error is one of the most characteristic features
598 of Socrates in the Republic. In all the different representations of
599 Socrates, whether of Xenophon or Plato, and amid the differences of
600 the earlier or later Dialogues, he always retains the character of the
601 unwearied and disinterested seeker after truth, without which he would
602 have ceased to be Socrates.
603 
604 Leaving the characters we may now analyse the contents of the Republic,
605 and then proceed to consider (1) The general aspects of this Hellenic
606 ideal of the State, (2) The modern lights in which the thoughts of Plato
607 may be read.
608 
609 BOOK I. The Republic opens with a truly Greek scene--a festival in
610 honour of the goddess Bendis which is held in the Piraeus; to this is
611 added the promise of an equestrian torch-race in the evening. The whole
612 work is supposed to be recited by Socrates on the day after the festival
613 to a small party, consisting of Critias, Timaeus, Hermocrates, and
614 another; this we learn from the first words of the Timaeus.
615 
616 When the rhetorical advantage of reciting the Dialogue has been gained,
617 the attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience; nor
618 is the reader further reminded of the extraordinary length of the
619 narrative. Of the numerous company, three only take any serious part in
620 the discussion; nor are we informed whether in the evening they went to
621 the torch-race, or talked, as in the Symposium, through the night.
622 The manner in which the conversation has arisen is described as
623 follows:--Socrates and his companion Glaucon are about to leave the
624 festival when they are detained by a message from Polemarchus, who
625 speedily appears accompanied by Adeimantus, the brother of Glaucon, and
626 with playful violence compels them to remain, promising them not only
627 the torch-race, but the pleasure of conversation with the young, which
628 to Socrates is a far greater attraction. They return to the house of
629 Cephalus, Polemarchus' father, now in extreme old age, who is found
630 sitting upon a cushioned seat crowned for a sacrifice. 'You should come
631 to me oftener, Socrates, for I am too old to go to you; and at my time
632 of life, having lost other pleasures, I care the more for conversation.'
633 Socrates asks him what he thinks of age, to which the old man replies,
634 that the sorrows and discontents of age are to be attributed to the
635 tempers of men, and that age is a time of peace in which the tyranny
636 of the passions is no longer felt. Yes, replies Socrates, but the world
637 will say, Cephalus, that you are happy in old age because you are rich.
638 'And there is something in what they say, Socrates, but not so much as
639 they imagine--as Themistocles replied to the Seriphian, "Neither you, if
640 you had been an Athenian, nor I, if I had been a Seriphian, would ever
641 have been famous," I might in like manner reply to you, Neither a good
642 poor man can be happy in age, nor yet a bad rich man.' Socrates remarks
643 that Cephalus appears not to care about riches, a quality which he
644 ascribes to his having inherited, not acquired them, and would like
645 to know what he considers to be the chief advantage of them. Cephalus
646 answers that when you are old the belief in the world below grows upon
647 you, and then to have done justice and never to have been compelled to
648 do injustice through poverty, and never to have deceived anyone, are
649 felt to be unspeakable blessings. Socrates, who is evidently preparing
650 for an argument, next asks, What is the meaning of the word justice? To
651 tell the truth and pay your debts? No more than this? Or must we admit
652 exceptions? Ought I, for example, to put back into the hands of my
653 friend, who has gone mad, the sword which I borrowed of him when he
654 was in his right mind? 'There must be exceptions.' 'And yet,' says
655 Polemarchus, 'the definition which has been given has the authority
656 of Simonides.' Here Cephalus retires to look after the sacrifices,
657 and bequeaths, as Socrates facetiously remarks, the possession of the
658 argument to his heir, Polemarchus...
659 
660 The description of old age is finished, and Plato, as his manner is, has
661 touched the key-note of the whole work in asking for the definition of
662 justice, first suggesting the question which Glaucon afterwards pursues
663 respecting external goods, and preparing for the concluding mythus of
664 the world below in the slight allusion of Cephalus. The portrait of the
665 just man is a natural frontispiece or introduction to the long discourse
666 which follows, and may perhaps imply that in all our perplexity about
667 the nature of justice, there is no difficulty in discerning 'who is
668 a just man.' The first explanation has been supported by a saying of
669 Simonides; and now Socrates has a mind to show that the resolution of
670 justice into two unconnected precepts, which have no common principle,
671 fails to satisfy the demands of dialectic.
672 
673 ...He proceeds: What did Simonides mean by this saying of his? Did he
674 mean that I was to give back arms to a madman? 'No, not in that case,
675 not if the parties are friends, and evil would result. He meant that you
676 were to do what was proper, good to friends and harm to enemies.' Every
677 act does something to somebody; and following this analogy, Socrates
678 asks, What is this due and proper thing which justice does, and to whom?
679 He is answered that justice does good to friends and harm to enemies.
680 But in what way good or harm? 'In making alliances with the one, and
681 going to war with the other.' Then in time of peace what is the good
682 of justice? The answer is that justice is of use in contracts, and
683 contracts are money partnerships. Yes; but how in such partnerships
684 is the just man of more use than any other man? 'When you want to have
685 money safely kept and not used.' Then justice will be useful when money
686 is useless. And there is another difficulty: justice, like the art of
687 war or any other art, must be of opposites, good at attack as well as
688 at defence, at stealing as well as at guarding. But then justice is a
689 thief, though a hero notwithstanding, like Autolycus, the Homeric hero,
690 who was 'excellent above all men in theft and perjury'--to such a pass
691 have you and Homer and Simonides brought us; though I do not forget that
692 the thieving must be for the good of friends and the harm of enemies.
693 And still there arises another question: Are friends to be interpreted
694 as real or seeming; enemies as real or seeming? And are our friends to
695 be only the good, and our enemies to be the evil? The answer is, that
696 we must do good to our seeming and real good friends, and evil to our
697 seeming and real evil enemies--good to the good, evil to the evil. But
698 ought we to render evil for evil at all, when to do so will only make
699 men more evil? Can justice produce injustice any more than the art of
700 horsemanship can make bad horsemen, or heat produce cold? The final
701 conclusion is, that no sage or poet ever said that the just return
702 evil for evil; this was a maxim of some rich and mighty man, Periander,
703 Perdiccas, or Ismenias the Theban (about B.C. 398-381)...
704 
705 Thus the first stage of aphoristic or unconscious morality is shown to
706 be inadequate to the wants of the age; the authority of the poets is set
707 aside, and through the winding mazes of dialectic we make an approach
708 to the Christian precept of forgiveness of injuries. Similar words
709 are applied by the Persian mystic poet to the Divine being when the
710 questioning spirit is stirred within him:--'If because I do evil, Thou
711 punishest me by evil, what is the difference between Thee and me?' In
712 this both Plato and Kheyam rise above the level of many Christian (?)
713 theologians. The first definition of justice easily passes into the
714 second; for the simple words 'to speak the truth and pay your debts' is
715 substituted the more abstract 'to do good to your friends and harm to
716 your enemies.' Either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule
717 of life for plain men, but they both fall short of the precision of
718 philosophy. We may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry, which not
719 only arises out of the conflict of established principles in particular
720 cases, but also out of the effort to attain them, and is prior as well
721 as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality. The 'interrogation'
722 of moral ideas; the appeal to the authority of Homer; the conclusion
723 that the maxim, 'Do good to your friends and harm to your enemies,'
724 being erroneous, could not have been the word of any great man, are all
725 of them very characteristic of the Platonic Socrates.
726 
727 ...Here Thrasymachus, who has made several attempts to interrupt, but
728 has hitherto been kept in order by the company, takes advantage of a
729 pause and rushes into the arena, beginning, like a savage animal, with a
730 roar. 'Socrates,' he says, 'what folly is this?--Why do you agree to be
731 vanquished by one another in a pretended argument?' He then prohibits
732 all the ordinary definitions of justice; to which Socrates replies that
733 he cannot tell how many twelve is, if he is forbidden to say 2 x 6, or
734 3 x 4, or 6 x 2, or 4 x 3. At first Thrasymachus is reluctant to argue;
735 but at length, with a promise of payment on the part of the company and
736 of praise from Socrates, he is induced to open the game. 'Listen,' he
737 says, 'my answer is that might is right, justice the interest of the
738 stronger: now praise me.' Let me understand you first. Do you mean that
739 because Polydamas the wrestler, who is stronger than we are, finds the
740 eating of beef for his interest, the eating of beef is also for our
741 interest, who are not so strong? Thrasymachus is indignant at the
742 illustration, and in pompous words, apparently intended to restore
743 dignity to the argument, he explains his meaning to be that the rulers
744 make laws for their own interests. But suppose, says Socrates, that the
745 ruler or stronger makes a mistake--then the interest of the stronger is
746 not his interest. Thrasymachus is saved from this speedy downfall by his
747 disciple Cleitophon, who introduces the word 'thinks;'--not the actual
748 interest of the ruler, but what he thinks or what seems to be his
749 interest, is justice. The contradiction is escaped by the unmeaning
750 evasion: for though his real and apparent interests may differ, what the
751 ruler thinks to be his interest will always remain what he thinks to be
752 his interest.
753 
754 Of course this was not the original assertion, nor is the new
755 interpretation accepted by Thrasymachus himself. But Socrates is not
756 disposed to quarrel about words, if, as he significantly insinuates,
757 his adversary has changed his mind. In what follows Thrasymachus does
758 in fact withdraw his admission that the ruler may make a mistake, for he
759 affirms that the ruler as a ruler is infallible. Socrates is quite ready
760 to accept the new position, which he equally turns against Thrasymachus
761 by the help of the analogy of the arts. Every art or science has an
762 interest, but this interest is to be distinguished from the accidental
763 interest of the artist, and is only concerned with the good of the
764 things or persons which come under the art. And justice has an interest
765 which is the interest not of the ruler or judge, but of those who come
766 under his sway.
767 
768 Thrasymachus is on the brink of the inevitable conclusion, when he makes
769 a bold diversion. 'Tell me, Socrates,' he says, 'have you a nurse?' What
770 a question! Why do you ask? 'Because, if you have, she neglects you and
771 lets you go about drivelling, and has not even taught you to know the
772 shepherd from the sheep. For you fancy that shepherds and rulers never
773 think of their own interest, but only of their sheep or subjects,
774 whereas the truth is that they fatten them for their use, sheep and
775 subjects alike. And experience proves that in every relation of life
776 the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer, especially where
777 injustice is on the grand scale, which is quite another thing from the
778 petty rogueries of swindlers and burglars and robbers of temples. The
779 language of men proves this--our 'gracious' and 'blessed' tyrant and the
780 like--all which tends to show (1) that justice is the interest of the
781 stronger; and (2) that injustice is more profitable and also stronger
782 than justice.'
783 
784 Thrasymachus, who is better at a speech than at a close argument, having
785 deluged the company with words, has a mind to escape. But the others
786 will not let him go, and Socrates adds a humble but earnest request that
787 he will not desert them at such a crisis of their fate. 'And what can I
788 do more for you?' he says; 'would you have me put the words bodily
789 into your souls?' God forbid! replies Socrates; but we want you to be
790 consistent in the use of terms, and not to employ 'physician' in an
791 exact sense, and then again 'shepherd' or 'ruler' in an inexact,--if the
792 words are strictly taken, the ruler and the shepherd look only to the
793 good of their people or flocks and not to their own: whereas you insist
794 that rulers are solely actuated by love of office. 'No doubt about it,'
795 replies Thrasymachus. Then why are they paid? Is not the reason, that
796 their interest is not comprehended in their art, and is therefore the
797 concern of another art, the art of pay, which is common to the arts in
798 general, and therefore not identical with any one of them? Nor would any
799 man be a ruler unless he were induced by the hope of reward or the fear
800 of punishment;--the reward is money or honour, the punishment is the
801 necessity of being ruled by a man worse than himself. And if a State (or
802 Church) were composed entirely of good men, they would be affected by
803 the last motive only; and there would be as much 'nolo episcopari' as
804 there is at present of the opposite...
805 
806 The satire on existing governments is heightened by the simple and
807 apparently incidental manner in which the last remark is introduced.
808 There is a similar irony in the argument that the governors of mankind
809 do not like being in office, and that therefore they demand pay.
810 
811 ...Enough of this: the other assertion of Thrasymachus is far more
812 important--that the unjust life is more gainful than the just. Now, as
813 you and I, Glaucon, are not convinced by him, we must reply to him; but
814 if we try to compare their respective gains we shall want a judge
815 to decide for us; we had better therefore proceed by making mutual
816 admissions of the truth to one another.
817 
818 Thrasymachus had asserted that perfect injustice was more gainful than
819 perfect justice, and after a little hesitation he is induced by Socrates
820 to admit the still greater paradox that injustice is virtue and justice
821 vice. Socrates praises his frankness, and assumes the attitude of one
822 whose only wish is to understand the meaning of his opponents. At the
823 same time he is weaving a net in which Thrasymachus is finally enclosed.
824 The admission is elicited from him that the just man seeks to gain an
825 advantage over the unjust only, but not over the just, while the unjust
826 would gain an advantage over either. Socrates, in order to test this
827 statement, employs once more the favourite analogy of the arts. The
828 musician, doctor, skilled artist of any sort, does not seek to gain more
829 than the skilled, but only more than the unskilled (that is to say, he
830 works up to a rule, standard, law, and does not exceed it), whereas the
831 unskilled makes random efforts at excess. Thus the skilled falls on the
832 side of the good, and the unskilled on the side of the evil, and the
833 just is the skilled, and the unjust is the unskilled.
834 
835 There was great difficulty in bringing Thrasymachus to the point; the
836 day was hot and he was streaming with perspiration, and for the first
837 time in his life he was seen to blush. But his other thesis that
838 injustice was stronger than justice has not yet been refuted, and
839 Socrates now proceeds to the consideration of this, which, with the
840 assistance of Thrasymachus, he hopes to clear up; the latter is at first
841 churlish, but in the judicious hands of Socrates is soon restored to
842 good-humour: Is there not honour among thieves? Is not the strength of
843 injustice only a remnant of justice? Is not absolute injustice absolute
844 weakness also? A house that is divided against itself cannot stand; two
845 men who quarrel detract from one another's strength, and he who is at
846 war with himself is the enemy of himself and the gods. Not wickedness
847 therefore, but semi-wickedness flourishes in states,--a remnant of
848 good is needed in order to make union in action possible,--there is no
849 kingdom of evil in this world.
850 
851 Another question has not been answered: Is the just or the unjust the
852 happier? To this we reply, that every art has an end and an excellence
853 or virtue by which the end is accomplished. And is not the end of
854 the soul happiness, and justice the excellence of the soul by which
855 happiness is attained? Justice and happiness being thus shown to be
856 inseparable, the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier
857 has disappeared.
858 
859 Thrasymachus replies: 'Let this be your entertainment, Socrates, at the
860 festival of Bendis.' Yes; and a very good entertainment with which your
861 kindness has supplied me, now that you have left off scolding. And yet
862 not a good entertainment--but that was my own fault, for I tasted of too
863 many things. First of all the nature of justice was the subject of our
864 enquiry, and then whether justice is virtue and wisdom, or evil and
865 folly; and then the comparative advantages of just and unjust: and the
866 sum of all is that I know not what justice is; how then shall I know
867 whether the just is happy or not?...
868 
869 Thus the sophistical fabric has been demolished, chiefly by appealing
870 to the analogy of the arts. 'Justice is like the arts (1) in having no
871 external interest, and (2) in not aiming at excess, and (3) justice is
872 to happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work.' At this
873 the modern reader is apt to stumble, because he forgets that Plato is
874 writing in an age when the arts and the virtues, like the moral
875 and intellectual faculties, were still undistinguished. Among early
876 enquirers into the nature of human action the arts helped to fill up
877 the void of speculation; and at first the comparison of the arts and the
878 virtues was not perceived by them to be fallacious. They only saw the
879 points of agreement in them and not the points of difference. Virtue,
880 like art, must take means to an end; good manners are both an art and
881 a virtue; character is naturally described under the image of a statue;
882 and there are many other figures of speech which are readily transferred
883 from art to morals. The next generation cleared up these perplexities;
884 or at least supplied after ages with a further analysis of them. The
885 contemporaries of Plato were in a state of transition, and had not yet
886 fully realized the common-sense distinction of Aristotle, that 'virtue
887 is concerned with action, art with production' (Nic. Eth.), or that
888 'virtue implies intention and constancy of purpose,' whereas 'art
889 requires knowledge only'. And yet in the absurdities which follow from
890 some uses of the analogy, there seems to be an intimation conveyed that
891 virtue is more than art. This is implied in the reductio ad absurdum
892 that 'justice is a thief,' and in the dissatisfaction which Socrates
893 expresses at the final result.
894 
895 The expression 'an art of pay' which is described as 'common to all the
896 arts' is not in accordance with the ordinary use of language. Nor is it
897 employed elsewhere either by Plato or by any other Greek writer. It is
898 suggested by the argument, and seems to extend the conception of art to
899 doing as well as making. Another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be
900 noted in the words 'men who are injured are made more unjust.' For
901 those who are injured are not necessarily made worse, but only harmed or
902 ill-treated.
903 
904 The second of the three arguments, 'that the just does not aim at
905 excess,' has a real meaning, though wrapped up in an enigmatical form.
906 That the good is of the nature of the finite is a peculiarly Hellenic
907 sentiment, which may be compared with the language of those modern
908 writers who speak of virtue as fitness, and of freedom as obedience to
909 law. The mathematical or logical notion of limit easily passes into an
910 ethical one, and even finds a mythological expression in the conception
911 of envy (Greek). Ideas of measure, equality, order, unity, proportion,
912 still linger in the writings of moralists; and the true spirit of the
913 fine arts is better conveyed by such terms than by superlatives.
914 
915    'When workmen strive to do better than well,
916    They do confound their skill in covetousness.'  (King John.)
917 
918 The harmony of the soul and body, and of the parts of the soul with
919 one another, a harmony 'fairer than that of musical notes,' is the true
920 Hellenic mode of conceiving the perfection of human nature.
921 
922 In what may be called the epilogue of the discussion with Thrasymachus,
923 Plato argues that evil is not a principle of strength, but of discord
924 and dissolution, just touching the question which has been often treated
925 in modern times by theologians and philosophers, of the negative nature
926 of evil. In the last argument we trace the germ of the Aristotelian
927 doctrine of an end and a virtue directed towards the end, which again is
928 suggested by the arts. The final reconcilement of justice and happiness
929 and the identity of the individual and the State are also intimated.
930 Socrates reassumes the character of a 'know-nothing;' at the same time
931 he appears to be not wholly satisfied with the manner in which the
932 argument has been conducted. Nothing is concluded; but the tendency of
933 the dialectical process, here as always, is to enlarge our conception of
934 ideas, and to widen their application to human life.
935 
936 BOOK II. Thrasymachus is pacified, but the intrepid Glaucon insists on
937 continuing the argument. He is not satisfied with the indirect manner
938 in which, at the end of the last book, Socrates had disposed of the
939 question 'Whether the just or the unjust is the happier.' He begins
940 by dividing goods into three classes:--first, goods desirable in
941 themselves; secondly, goods desirable in themselves and for their
942 results; thirdly, goods desirable for their results only. He then asks
943 Socrates in which of the three classes he would place justice. In the
944 second class, replies Socrates, among goods desirable for themselves and
945 also for their results. 'Then the world in general are of another mind,
946 for they say that justice belongs to the troublesome class of goods
947 which are desirable for their results only. Socrates answers that this
948 is the doctrine of Thrasymachus which he rejects. Glaucon thinks that
949 Thrasymachus was too ready to listen to the voice of the charmer, and
950 proposes to consider the nature of justice and injustice in themselves
951 and apart from the results and rewards of them which the world is always
952 dinning in his ears. He will first of all speak of the nature and origin
953 of justice; secondly, of the manner in which men view justice as a
954 necessity and not a good; and thirdly, he will prove the reasonableness
955 of this view.
956 
957 'To do injustice is said to be a good; to suffer injustice an evil. As
958 the evil is discovered by experience to be greater than the good, the
959 sufferers, who cannot also be doers, make a compact that they will have
960 neither, and this compact or mean is called justice, but is really the
961 impossibility of doing injustice. No one would observe such a compact
962 if he were not obliged. Let us suppose that the just and unjust have
963 two rings, like that of Gyges in the well-known story, which make them
964 invisible, and then no difference will appear in them, for every one
965 will do evil if he can. And he who abstains will be regarded by the
966 world as a fool for his pains. Men may praise him in public out of
967 fear for themselves, but they will laugh at him in their hearts (Cp.
968 Gorgias.)
969 
970 'And now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust. Imagine the
971 unjust man to be master of his craft, seldom making mistakes and easily
972 correcting them; having gifts of money, speech, strength--the greatest
973 villain bearing the highest character: and at his side let us place the
974 just in his nobleness and simplicity--being, not seeming--without name
975 or reward--clothed in his justice only--the best of men who is thought
976 to be the worst, and let him die as he has lived. I might add (but
977 I would rather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrists of
978 injustice--they will tell you) that the just man will be scourged,
979 racked, bound, will have his eyes put out, and will at last be crucified
980 (literally impaled)--and all this because he ought to have preferred
981 seeming to being. How different is the case of the unjust who clings to
982 appearance as the true reality! His high character makes him a ruler;
983 he can marry where he likes, trade where he likes, help his friends and
984 hurt his enemies; having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods
985 better, and will therefore be more loved by them than the just.'
986 
987 I was thinking what to answer, when Adeimantus joined in the already
988 unequal fray. He considered that the most important point of all had
989 been omitted:--'Men are taught to be just for the sake of rewards;
990 parents and guardians make reputation the incentive to virtue. And other
991 advantages are promised by them of a more solid kind, such as wealthy
992 marriages and high offices. There are the pictures in Homer and Hesiod
993 of fat sheep and heavy fleeces, rich corn-fields and trees toppling with
994 fruit, which the gods provide in this life for the just. And the Orphic
995 poets add a similar picture of another. The heroes of Musaeus and
996 Eumolpus lie on couches at a festival, with garlands on their heads,
997 enjoying as the meed of virtue a paradise of immortal drunkenness.
998 Some go further, and speak of a fair posterity in the third and fourth
999 generation. But the wicked they bury in a slough and make them carry
1000 water in a sieve: and in this life they attribute to them the infamy
1001 which Glaucon was assuming to be the lot of the just who are supposed to
1002 be unjust.
1003 
1004 'Take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and
1005 prose:--"Virtue," as Hesiod says, "is honourable but difficult, vice is
1006 easy and profitable." You may often see the wicked in great prosperity
1007 and the righteous afflicted by the will of heaven. And mendicant
1008 prophets knock at rich men's doors, promising to atone for the sins
1009 of themselves or their fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and
1010 festive games, or with charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy
1011 good or bad by divine help and at a small charge;--they appeal to books
1012 professing to be written by Musaeus and Orpheus, and carry away the
1013 minds of whole cities, and promise to "get souls out of purgatory;" and
1014 if we refuse to listen to them, no one knows what will happen to us.
1015 
1016 'When a lively-minded ingenuous youth hears all this, what will be his
1017 conclusion? "Will he," in the language of Pindar, "make justice his high
1018 tower, or fortify himself with crooked deceit?" Justice, he reflects,
1019 without the appearance of justice, is misery and ruin; injustice has the
1020 promise of a glorious life. Appearance is master of truth and lord of
1021 happiness. To appearance then I will turn,--I will put on the show
1022 of virtue and trail behind me the fox of Archilochus. I hear some one
1023 saying that "wickedness is not easily concealed," to which I reply that
1024 "nothing great is easy." Union and force and rhetoric will do much; and
1025 if men say that they cannot prevail over the gods, still how do we know
1026 that there are gods? Only from the poets, who acknowledge that they may
1027 be appeased by sacrifices. Then why not sin and pay for indulgences out
1028 of your sin? For if the righteous are only unpunished, still they have
1029 no further reward, while the wicked may be unpunished and have the
1030 pleasure of sinning too. But what of the world below? Nay, says the
1031 argument, there are atoning powers who will set that matter right, as
1032 the poets, who are the sons of the gods, tell us; and this is confirmed
1033 by the authority of the State.
1034 
1035 'How can we resist such arguments in favour of injustice? Add good
1036 manners, and, as the wise tell us, we shall make the best of both
1037 worlds. Who that is not a miserable caitiff will refrain from smiling at
1038 the praises of justice? Even if a man knows the better part he will not
1039 be angry with others; for he knows also that more than human virtue is
1040 needed to save a man, and that he only praises justice who is incapable
1041 of injustice.
1042 
1043 'The origin of the evil is that all men from the beginning, heroes,
1044 poets, instructors of youth, have always asserted "the temporal
1045 dispensation," the honours and profits of justice. Had we been taught in
1046 early youth the power of justice and injustice inherent in the soul, and
1047 unseen by any human or divine eye, we should not have needed others to
1048 be our guardians, but every one would have been the guardian of himself.
1049 This is what I want you to show, Socrates;--other men use arguments
1050 which rather tend to strengthen the position of Thrasymachus that "might
1051 is right;" but from you I expect better things. And please, as Glaucon
1052 said, to exclude reputation; let the just be thought unjust and the
1053 unjust just, and do you still prove to us the superiority of justice'...
1054 
1055 The thesis, which for the sake of argument has been maintained by
1056 Glaucon, is the converse of that of Thrasymachus--not right is the
1057 interest of the stronger, but right is the necessity of the weaker.
1058 Starting from the same premises he carries the analysis of society a
1059 step further back;--might is still right, but the might is the weakness
1060 of the many combined against the strength of the few.
1061 
1062 There have been theories in modern as well as in ancient times which
1063 have a family likeness to the speculations of Glaucon; e.g. that power
1064 is the foundation of right; or that a monarch has a divine right to
1065 govern well or ill; or that virtue is self-love or the love of power; or
1066 that war is the natural state of man; or that private vices are public
1067 benefits. All such theories have a kind of plausibility from their
1068 partial agreement with experience. For human nature oscillates between
1069 good and evil, and the motives of actions and the origin of institutions
1070 may be explained to a certain extent on either hypothesis according to
1071 the character or point of view of a particular thinker. The obligation
1072 of maintaining authority under all circumstances and sometimes by rather
1073 questionable means is felt strongly and has become a sort of instinct
1074 among civilized men. The divine right of kings, or more generally of
1075 governments, is one of the forms under which this natural feeling is
1076 expressed. Nor again is there any evil which has not some accompaniment
1077 of good or pleasure; nor any good which is free from some alloy of evil;
1078 nor any noble or generous thought which may not be attended by a shadow
1079 or the ghost of a shadow of self-interest or of self-love. We know that
1080 all human actions are imperfect; but we do not therefore attribute
1081 them to the worse rather than to the better motive or principle. Such
1082 a philosophy is both foolish and false, like that opinion of the clever
1083 rogue who assumes all other men to be like himself. And theories of this
1084 sort do not represent the real nature of the State, which is based on a
1085 vague sense of right gradually corrected and enlarged by custom and law
1086 (although capable also of perversion), any more than they describe the
1087 origin of society, which is to be sought in the family and in the
1088 social and religious feelings of man. Nor do they represent the average
1089 character of individuals, which cannot be explained simply on a theory
1090 of evil, but has always a counteracting element of good. And as men
1091 become better such theories appear more and more untruthful to them,
1092 because they are more conscious of their own disinterestedness. A little
1093 experience may make a man a cynic; a great deal will bring him back to
1094 a truer and kindlier view of the mixed nature of himself and his fellow
1095 men.
1096 
1097 The two brothers ask Socrates to prove to them that the just is happy
1098 when they have taken from him all that in which happiness is ordinarily
1099 supposed to consist. Not that there is (1) any absurdity in the attempt
1100 to frame a notion of justice apart from circumstances. For the ideal
1101 must always be a paradox when compared with the ordinary conditions of
1102 human life. Neither the Stoical ideal nor the Christian ideal is true as
1103 a fact, but they may serve as a basis of education, and may exercise an
1104 ennobling influence. An ideal is none the worse because 'some one has
1105 made the discovery' that no such ideal was ever realized. And in a
1106 few exceptional individuals who are raised above the ordinary level of
1107 humanity, the ideal of happiness may be realized in death and misery.
1108 This may be the state which the reason deliberately approves, and which
1109 the utilitarian as well as every other moralist may be bound in certain
1110 cases to prefer.
1111 
1112 Nor again, (2) must we forget that Plato, though he agrees generally
1113 with the view implied in the argument of the two brothers, is not
1114 expressing his own final conclusion, but rather seeking to dramatize one
1115 of the aspects of ethical truth. He is developing his idea gradually in
1116 a series of positions or situations. He is exhibiting Socrates for the
1117 first time undergoing the Socratic interrogation. Lastly, (3) the word
1118 'happiness' involves some degree of confusion because associated in the
1119 language of modern philosophy with conscious pleasure or satisfaction,
1120 which was not equally present to his mind.
1121 
1122 Glaucon has been drawing a picture of the misery of the just and the
1123 happiness of the unjust, to which the misery of the tyrant in Book IX is
1124 the answer and parallel. And still the unjust must appear just; that is
1125 'the homage which vice pays to virtue.' But now Adeimantus, taking up
1126 the hint which had been already given by Glaucon, proceeds to show
1127 that in the opinion of mankind justice is regarded only for the sake of
1128 rewards and reputation, and points out the advantage which is given to
1129 such arguments as those of Thrasymachus and Glaucon by the conventional
1130 morality of mankind. He seems to feel the difficulty of 'justifying the
1131 ways of God to man.' Both the brothers touch upon the question, whether
1132 the morality of actions is determined by their consequences; and both
1133 of them go beyond the position of Socrates, that justice belongs to
1134 the class of goods not desirable for themselves only, but desirable for
1135 themselves and for their results, to which he recalls them. In
1136 their attempt to view justice as an internal principle, and in their
1137 condemnation of the poets, they anticipate him. The common life of
1138 Greece is not enough for them; they must penetrate deeper into the
1139 nature of things.
1140 
1141 It has been objected that justice is honesty in the sense of Glaucon and
1142 Adeimantus, but is taken by Socrates to mean all virtue. May we not
1143 more truly say that the old-fashioned notion of justice is enlarged by
1144 Socrates, and becomes equivalent to universal order or well-being, first
1145 in the State, and secondly in the individual? He has found a new answer
1146 to his old question (Protag.), 'whether the virtues are one or many,'
1147 viz. that one is the ordering principle of the three others. In seeking
1148 to establish the purely internal nature of justice, he is met by the
1149 fact that man is a social being, and he tries to harmonise the two
1150 opposite theses as well as he can. There is no more inconsistency in
1151 this than was inevitable in his age and country; there is no use in
1152 turning upon him the cross lights of modern philosophy, which, from some
1153 other point of view, would appear equally inconsistent. Plato does not
1154 give the final solution of philosophical questions for us; nor can he be
1155 judged of by our standard.
1156 
1157 The remainder of the Republic is developed out of the question of
1158 the sons of Ariston. Three points are deserving of remark in what
1159 immediately follows:--First, that the answer of Socrates is altogether
1160 indirect. He does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation
1161 of the idea of justice, and still less will he be tempted to affirm the
1162 Stoical paradox that the just man can be happy on the rack. But first he
1163 dwells on the difficulty of the problem and insists on restoring man to
1164 his natural condition, before he will answer the question at all. He
1165 too will frame an ideal, but his ideal comprehends not only abstract
1166 justice, but the whole relations of man. Under the fanciful illustration
1167 of the large letters he implies that he will only look for justice in
1168 society, and that from the State he will proceed to the individual. His
1169 answer in substance amounts to this,--that under favourable conditions,
1170 i.e. in the perfect State, justice and happiness will coincide, and that
1171 when justice has been once found, happiness may be left to take care
1172 of itself. That he falls into some degree of inconsistency, when in
1173 the tenth book he claims to have got rid of the rewards and honours
1174 of justice, may be admitted; for he has left those which exist in the
1175 perfect State. And the philosopher 'who retires under the shelter of a
1176 wall' can hardly have been esteemed happy by him, at least not in this
1177 world. Still he maintains the true attitude of moral action. Let a man
1178 do his duty first, without asking whether he will be happy or not, and
1179 happiness will be the inseparable accident which attends him. 'Seek ye
1180 first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things
1181 shall be added unto you.'
1182 
1183 Secondly, it may be remarked that Plato preserves the genuine character
1184 of Greek thought in beginning with the State and in going on to the
1185 individual. First ethics, then politics--this is the order of ideas to
1186 us; the reverse is the order of history. Only after many struggles of
1187 thought does the individual assert his right as a moral being. In early
1188 ages he is not ONE, but one of many, the citizen of a State which is
1189 prior to him; and he has no notion of good or evil apart from the law
1190 of his country or the creed of his church. And to this type he is
1191 constantly tending to revert, whenever the influence of custom, or of
1192 party spirit, or the recollection of the past becomes too strong for
1193 him.
1194 
1195 Thirdly, we may observe the confusion or identification of the
1196 individual and the State, of ethics and politics, which pervades early
1197 Greek speculation, and even in modern times retains a certain degree of
1198 influence. The subtle difference between the collective and individual
1199 action of mankind seems to have escaped early thinkers, and we too are
1200 sometimes in danger of forgetting the conditions of united human action,
1201 whenever we either elevate politics into ethics, or lower ethics to the
1202 standard of politics. The good man and the good citizen only coincide in
1203 the perfect State; and this perfection cannot be attained by legislation
1204 acting upon them from without, but, if at all, by education fashioning
1205 them from within.
1206 
1207 ...Socrates praises the sons of Ariston, 'inspired offspring of
1208 the renowned hero,' as the elegiac poet terms them; but he does not
1209 understand how they can argue so eloquently on behalf of injustice while
1210 their character shows that they are uninfluenced by their own arguments.
1211 He knows not how to answer them, although he is afraid of deserting
1212 justice in the hour of need. He therefore makes a condition, that having
1213 weak eyes he shall be allowed to read the large letters first and then
1214 go on to the smaller, that is, he must look for justice in the State
1215 first, and will then proceed to the individual. Accordingly he begins to
1216 construct the State.
1217 
1218 Society arises out of the wants of man. His first want is food; his
1219 second a house; his third a coat. The sense of these needs and the
1220 possibility of satisfying them by exchange, draw individuals together on
1221 the same spot; and this is the beginning of a State, which we take the
1222 liberty to invent, although necessity is the real inventor. There must
1223 be first a husbandman, secondly a builder, thirdly a weaver, to which
1224 may be added a cobbler. Four or five citizens at least are required to
1225 make a city. Now men have different natures, and one man will do one
1226 thing better than many; and business waits for no man. Hence there must
1227 be a division of labour into different employments; into wholesale
1228 and retail trade; into workers, and makers of workmen's tools; into
1229 shepherds and husbandmen. A city which includes all this will have far
1230 exceeded the limit of four or five, and yet not be very large. But then
1231 again imports will be required, and imports necessitate exports,
1232 and this implies variety of produce in order to attract the taste of
1233 purchasers; also merchants and ships. In the city too we must have a
1234 market and money and retail trades; otherwise buyers and sellers will
1235 never meet, and the valuable time of the producers will be wasted in
1236 vain efforts at exchange. If we add hired servants the State will be
1237 complete. And we may guess that somewhere in the intercourse of the
1238 citizens with one another justice and injustice will appear.
1239 
1240 Here follows a rustic picture of their way of life. They spend their
1241 days in houses which they have built for themselves; they make their
1242 own clothes and produce their own corn and wine. Their principal food is
1243 meal and flour, and they drink in moderation. They live on the best
1244 of terms with each other, and take care not to have too many children.
1245 'But,' said Glaucon, interposing, 'are they not to have a relish?'
1246 Certainly; they will have salt and olives and cheese, vegetables and
1247 fruits, and chestnuts to roast at the fire. ''Tis a city of pigs,
1248 Socrates.' Why, I replied, what do you want more? 'Only the comforts of
1249 life,--sofas and tables, also sauces and sweets.' I see; you want not
1250 only a State, but a luxurious State; and possibly in the more complex
1251 frame we may sooner find justice and injustice. Then the fine arts must
1252 go to work--every conceivable instrument and ornament of luxury will be
1253 wanted. There will be dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, cooks,
1254 barbers, tire-women, nurses, artists; swineherds and neatherds too for
1255 the animals, and physicians to cure the disorders of which luxury is the
1256 source. To feed all these superfluous mouths we shall need a part of
1257 our neighbour's land, and they will want a part of ours. And this is the
1258 origin of war, which may be traced to the same causes as other political
1259 evils. Our city will now require the slight addition of a camp, and
1260 the citizen will be converted into a soldier. But then again our old
1261 doctrine of the division of labour must not be forgotten. The art of
1262 war cannot be learned in a day, and there must be a natural aptitude
1263 for military duties. There will be some warlike natures who have this
1264 aptitude--dogs keen of scent, swift of foot to pursue, and strong of
1265 limb to fight. And as spirit is the foundation of courage, such natures,
1266 whether of men or animals, will be full of spirit. But these spirited
1267 natures are apt to bite and devour one another; the union of
1268 gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies appears to be an
1269 impossibility, and the guardian of a State requires both qualities. Who
1270 then can be a guardian? The image of the dog suggests an answer. For
1271 dogs are gentle to friends and fierce to strangers. Your dog is a
1272 philosopher who judges by the rule of knowing or not knowing; and
1273 philosophy, whether in man or beast, is the parent of gentleness. The
1274 human watchdogs must be philosophers or lovers of learning which will
1275 make them gentle. And how are they to be learned without education?
1276 
1277 But what shall their education be? Is any better than the old-fashioned
1278 sort which is comprehended under the name of music and gymnastic? Music
1279 includes literature, and literature is of two kinds, true and false.
1280 'What do you mean?' he said. I mean that children hear stories before
1281 they learn gymnastics, and that the stories are either untrue, or have
1282 at most one or two grains of truth in a bushel of falsehood. Now early
1283 life is very impressible, and children ought not to learn what they will
1284 have to unlearn when they grow up; we must therefore have a censorship
1285 of nursery tales, banishing some and keeping others. Some of them are
1286 very improper, as we may see in the great instances of Homer and Hesiod,
1287 who not only tell lies but bad lies; stories about Uranus and Saturn,
1288 which are immoral as well as false, and which should never be spoken of
1289 to young persons, or indeed at all; or, if at all, then in a mystery,
1290 after the sacrifice, not of an Eleusinian pig, but of some unprocurable
1291 animal. Shall our youth be encouraged to beat their fathers by the
1292 example of Zeus, or our citizens be incited to quarrel by hearing or
1293 seeing representations of strife among the gods? Shall they listen to
1294 the narrative of Hephaestus binding his mother, and of Zeus sending him
1295 flying for helping her when she was beaten? Such tales may possibly have
1296 a mystical interpretation, but the young are incapable of understanding
1297 allegory. If any one asks what tales are to be allowed, we will answer
1298 that we are legislators and not book-makers; we only lay down the
1299 principles according to which books are to be written; to write them is
1300 the duty of others.
1301 
1302 And our first principle is, that God must be represented as he is; not
1303 as the author of all things, but of good only. We will not suffer the
1304 poets to say that he is the steward of good and evil, or that he has two
1305 casks full of destinies;--or that Athene and Zeus incited Pandarus to
1306 break the treaty; or that God caused the sufferings of Niobe, or of
1307 Pelops, or the Trojan war; or that he makes men sin when he wishes to
1308 destroy them. Either these were not the actions of the gods, or God was
1309 just, and men were the better for being punished. But that the deed was
1310 evil, and God the author, is a wicked, suicidal fiction which we will
1311 allow no one, old or young, to utter. This is our first and great
1312 principle--God is the author of good only.
1313 
1314 And the second principle is like unto it:--With God is no variableness
1315 or change of form. Reason teaches us this; for if we suppose a change
1316 in God, he must be changed either by another or by himself. By
1317 another?--but the best works of nature and art and the noblest qualities
1318 of mind are least liable to be changed by any external force. By
1319 himself?--but he cannot change for the better; he will hardly change
1320 for the worse. He remains for ever fairest and best in his own image.
1321 Therefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of Here begging
1322 in the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at
1323 night in strange disguises; all that blasphemous nonsense with which
1324 mothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed. But
1325 some one will say that God, who is himself unchangeable, may take a form
1326 in relation to us. Why should he? For gods as well as men hate the lie
1327 in the soul, or principle of falsehood; and as for any other form of
1328 lying which is used for a purpose and is regarded as innocent in certain
1329 exceptional cases--what need have the gods of this? For they are not
1330 ignorant of antiquity like the poets, nor are they afraid of their
1331 enemies, nor is any madman a friend of theirs. God then is true, he is
1332 absolutely true; he changes not, he deceives not, by day or night, by
1333 word or sign. This is our second great principle--God is true. Away
1334 with the lying dream of Agamemnon in Homer, and the accusation of Thetis
1335 against Apollo in Aeschylus...
1336 
1337 In order to give clearness to his conception of the State, Plato
1338 proceeds to trace the first principles of mutual need and of division
1339 of labour in an imaginary community of four or five citizens. Gradually
1340 this community increases; the division of labour extends to countries;
1341 imports necessitate exports; a medium of exchange is required, and
1342 retailers sit in the market-place to save the time of the producers.
1343 These are the steps by which Plato constructs the first or primitive
1344 State, introducing the elements of political economy by the way. As
1345 he is going to frame a second or civilized State, the simple naturally
1346 comes before the complex. He indulges, like Rousseau, in a picture of
1347 primitive life--an idea which has indeed often had a powerful influence
1348 on the imagination of mankind, but he does not seriously mean to say
1349 that one is better than the other (Politicus); nor can any inference
1350 be drawn from the description of the first state taken apart from the
1351 second, such as Aristotle appears to draw in the Politics. We should not
1352 interpret a Platonic dialogue any more than a poem or a parable in too
1353 literal or matter-of-fact a style. On the other hand, when we compare
1354 the lively fancy of Plato with the dried-up abstractions of modern
1355 treatises on philosophy, we are compelled to say with Protagoras, that
1356 the 'mythus is more interesting' (Protag.)
1357 
1358 Several interesting remarks which in modern times would have a place in
1359 a treatise on Political Economy are scattered up and down the writings
1360 of Plato: especially Laws, Population; Free Trade; Adulteration; Wills
1361 and Bequests; Begging; Eryxias, (though not Plato's), Value and Demand;
1362 Republic, Division of Labour. The last subject, and also the origin of
1363 Retail Trade, is treated with admirable lucidity in the second book of
1364 the Republic. But Plato never combined his economic ideas into a system,
1365 and never seems to have recognized that Trade is one of the great motive
1366 powers of the State and of the world. He would make retail traders
1367 only of the inferior sort of citizens (Rep., Laws), though he remarks,
1368 quaintly enough (Laws), that 'if only the best men and the best women
1369 everywhere were compelled to keep taverns for a time or to carry on
1370 retail trade, etc., then we should knew how pleasant and agreeable all
1371 these things are.'
1372 
1373 The disappointment of Glaucon at the 'city of pigs,' the ludicrous
1374 description of the ministers of luxury in the more refined State, and
1375 the afterthought of the necessity of doctors, the illustration of the
1376 nature of the guardian taken from the dog, the desirableness of
1377 offering some almost unprocurable victim when impure mysteries are to be
1378 celebrated, the behaviour of Zeus to his father and of Hephaestus to
1379 his mother, are touches of humour which have also a serious meaning. In
1380 speaking of education Plato rather startles us by affirming that a child
1381 must be trained in falsehood first and in truth afterwards. Yet this is
1382 not very different from saying that children must be taught through
1383 the medium of imagination as well as reason; that their minds can only
1384 develope gradually, and that there is much which they must learn without
1385 understanding. This is also the substance of Plato's view, though he
1386 must be acknowledged to have drawn the line somewhat differently from
1387 modern ethical writers, respecting truth and falsehood. To us, economies
1388 or accommodations would not be allowable unless they were required by
1389 the human faculties or necessary for the communication of knowledge to
1390 the simple and ignorant. We should insist that the word was inseparable
1391 from the intention, and that we must not be 'falsely true,' i.e. speak
1392 or act falsely in support of what was right or true. But Plato would
1393 limit the use of fictions only by requiring that they should have a good
1394 moral effect, and that such a dangerous weapon as falsehood should be
1395 employed by the rulers alone and for great objects.
1396 
1397 A Greek in the age of Plato attached no importance to the question
1398 whether his religion was an historical fact. He was just beginning to be
1399 conscious that the past had a history; but he could see nothing beyond
1400 Homer and Hesiod. Whether their narratives were true or false did not
1401 seriously affect the political or social life of Hellas. Men only began
1402 to suspect that they were fictions when they recognised them to be
1403 immoral. And so in all religions: the consideration of their morality
1404 comes first, afterwards the truth of the documents in which they are
1405 recorded, or of the events natural or supernatural which are told of
1406 them. But in modern times, and in Protestant countries perhaps more than
1407 in Catholic, we have been too much inclined to identify the historical
1408 with the moral; and some have refused to believe in religion at all,
1409 unless a superhuman accuracy was discernible in every part of the
1410 record. The facts of an ancient or religious history are amongst the
1411 most important of all facts; but they are frequently uncertain, and we
1412 only learn the true lesson which is to be gathered from them when we
1413 place ourselves above them. These reflections tend to show that the
1414 difference between Plato and ourselves, though not unimportant, is not
1415 so great as might at first sight appear. For we should agree with him
1416 in placing the moral before the historical truth of religion; and,
1417 generally, in disregarding those errors or misstatements of fact which
1418 necessarily occur in the early stages of all religions. We know also
1419 that changes in the traditions of a country cannot be made in a day; and
1420 are therefore tolerant of many things which science and criticism would
1421 condemn.
1422 
1423 We note in passing that the allegorical interpretation of mythology,
1424 said to have been first introduced as early as the sixth century before
1425 Christ by Theagenes of Rhegium, was well established in the age of
1426 Plato, and here, as in the Phaedrus, though for a different reason, was
1427 rejected by him. That anachronisms whether of religion or law, when
1428 men have reached another stage of civilization, should be got rid of by
1429 fictions is in accordance with universal experience. Great is the art of
1430 interpretation; and by a natural process, which when once discovered was
1431 always going on, what could not be altered was explained away. And so
1432 without any palpable inconsistency there existed side by side two forms
1433 of religion, the tradition inherited or invented by the poets and
1434 the customary worship of the temple; on the other hand, there was the
1435 religion of the philosopher, who was dwelling in the heaven of ideas,
1436 but did not therefore refuse to offer a cock to Aesculapius, or to
1437 be seen saying his prayers at the rising of the sun. At length the
1438 antagonism between the popular and philosophical religion, never so
1439 great among the Greeks as in our own age, disappeared, and was only felt
1440 like the difference between the religion of the educated and uneducated
1441 among ourselves. The Zeus of Homer and Hesiod easily passed into
1442 the 'royal mind' of Plato (Philebus); the giant Heracles became the
1443 knight-errant and benefactor of mankind. These and still more wonderful
1444 transformations were readily effected by the ingenuity of Stoics and
1445 neo-Platonists in the two or three centuries before and after Christ.
1446 The Greek and Roman religions were gradually permeated by the spirit of
1447 philosophy; having lost their ancient meaning, they were resolved into
1448 poetry and morality; and probably were never purer than at the time of
1449 their decay, when their influence over the world was waning.
1450 
1451 A singular conception which occurs towards the end of the book is
1452 the lie in the soul; this is connected with the Platonic and Socratic
1453 doctrine that involuntary ignorance is worse than voluntary. The lie
1454 in the soul is a true lie, the corruption of the highest truth, the
1455 deception of the highest part of the soul, from which he who is deceived
1456 has no power of delivering himself. For example, to represent God
1457 as false or immoral, or, according to Plato, as deluding men with
1458 appearances or as the author of evil; or again, to affirm with
1459 Protagoras that 'knowledge is sensation,' or that 'being is becoming,'
1460 or with Thrasymachus 'that might is right,' would have been regarded by
1461 Plato as a lie of this hateful sort. The greatest unconsciousness of the
1462 greatest untruth, e.g. if, in the language of the Gospels (John), 'he
1463 who was blind' were to say 'I see,' is another aspect of the state
1464 of mind which Plato is describing. The lie in the soul may be further
1465 compared with the sin against the Holy Ghost (Luke), allowing for the
1466 difference between Greek and Christian modes of speaking. To this is
1467 opposed the lie in words, which is only such a deception as may occur
1468 in a play or poem, or allegory or figure of speech, or in any sort of
1469 accommodation,--which though useless to the gods may be useful to men
1470 in certain cases. Socrates is here answering the question which he had
1471 himself raised about the propriety of deceiving a madman; and he is also
1472 contrasting the nature of God and man. For God is Truth, but mankind can
1473 only be true by appearing sometimes to be partial, or false. Reserving
1474 for another place the greater questions of religion or education, we
1475 may note further, (1) the approval of the old traditional education
1476 of Greece; (2) the preparation which Plato is making for the attack on
1477 Homer and the poets; (3) the preparation which he is also making for the
1478 use of economies in the State; (4) the contemptuous and at the same time
1479 euphemistic manner in which here as below he alludes to the 'Chronique
1480 Scandaleuse' of the gods.
1481 
1482 BOOK III. There is another motive in purifying religion, which is to
1483 banish fear; for no man can be courageous who is afraid of death, or who
1484 believes the tales which are repeated by the poets concerning the world
1485 below. They must be gently requested not to abuse hell; they may be
1486 reminded that their stories are both untrue and discouraging. Nor must
1487 they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages, such as the depressing
1488 words of Achilles--'I would rather be a serving-man than rule over
1489 all the dead;' and the verses which tell of the squalid mansions, the
1490 senseless shadows, the flitting soul mourning over lost strength and
1491 youth, the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke, or
1492 the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats. The terrors and
1493 horrors of Cocytus and Styx, ghosts and sapless shades, and the rest
1494 of their Tartarean nomenclature, must vanish. Such tales may have their
1495 use; but they are not the proper food for soldiers. As little can we
1496 admit the sorrows and sympathies of the Homeric heroes:--Achilles, the
1497 son of Thetis, in tears, throwing ashes on his head, or pacing up and
1498 down the sea-shore in distraction; or Priam, the cousin of the gods,
1499 crying aloud, rolling in the mire. A good man is not prostrated at
1500 the loss of children or fortune. Neither is death terrible to him; and
1501 therefore lamentations over the dead should not be practised by men of
1502 note; they should be the concern of inferior persons only, whether women
1503 or men. Still worse is the attribution of such weakness to the gods; as
1504 when the goddesses say, 'Alas! my travail!' and worst of all, when the
1505 king of heaven himself laments his inability to save Hector, or sorrows
1506 over the impending doom of his dear Sarpedon. Such a character of God,
1507 if not ridiculed by our young men, is likely to be imitated by them.
1508 Nor should our citizens be given to excess of laughter--'Such violent
1509 delights' are followed by a violent re-action. The description in the
1510 Iliad of the gods shaking their sides at the clumsiness of Hephaestus
1511 will not be admitted by us. 'Certainly not.'
1512 
1513 Truth should have a high place among the virtues, for falsehood, as
1514 we were saying, is useless to the gods, and only useful to men as a
1515 medicine. But this employment of falsehood must remain a privilege of
1516 state; the common man must not in return tell a lie to the ruler; any
1517 more than the patient would tell a lie to his physician, or the sailor
1518 to his captain.
1519 
1520 In the next place our youth must be temperate, and temperance consists
1521 in self-control and obedience to authority. That is a lesson which Homer
1522 teaches in some places: 'The Achaeans marched on breathing prowess, in
1523 silent awe of their leaders;'--but a very different one in other places:
1524 'O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog, but the heart of a
1525 stag.' Language of the latter kind will not impress self-control on the
1526 minds of youth. The same may be said about his praises of eating and
1527 drinking and his dread of starvation; also about the verses in which he
1528 tells of the rapturous loves of Zeus and Here, or of how Hephaestus once
1529 detained Ares and Aphrodite in a net on a similar occasion. There is a
1530 nobler strain heard in the words:--'Endure, my soul, thou hast endured
1531 worse.' Nor must we allow our citizens to receive bribes, or to say,
1532 'Gifts persuade the gods, gifts reverend kings;' or to applaud the
1533 ignoble advice of Phoenix to Achilles that he should get money out of
1534 the Greeks before he assisted them; or the meanness of Achilles himself
1535 in taking gifts from Agamemnon; or his requiring a ransom for the body
1536 of Hector; or his cursing of Apollo; or his insolence to the river-god
1537 Scamander; or his dedication to the dead Patroclus of his own hair which
1538 had been already dedicated to the other river-god Spercheius; or his
1539 cruelty in dragging the body of Hector round the walls, and slaying
1540 the captives at the pyre: such a combination of meanness and cruelty in
1541 Cheiron's pupil is inconceivable. The amatory exploits of Peirithous and
1542 Theseus are equally unworthy. Either these so-called sons of gods were
1543 not the sons of gods, or they were not such as the poets imagine them,
1544 any more than the gods themselves are the authors of evil. The youth who
1545 believes that such things are done by those who have the blood of heaven
1546 flowing in their veins will be too ready to imitate their example.
1547 
1548 Enough of gods and heroes;--what shall we say about men? What the poets
1549 and story-tellers say--that the wicked prosper and the righteous are
1550 afflicted, or that justice is another's gain? Such misrepresentations
1551 cannot be allowed by us. But in this we are anticipating the definition
1552 of justice, and had therefore better defer the enquiry.
1553 
1554 The subjects of poetry have been sufficiently treated; next follows
1555 style. Now all poetry is a narrative of events past, present, or to
1556 come; and narrative is of three kinds, the simple, the imitative, and
1557 a composition of the two. An instance will make my meaning clear.
1558 The first scene in Homer is of the last or mixed kind, being partly
1559 description and partly dialogue. But if you throw the dialogue into the
1560 'oratio obliqua,' the passage will run thus: The priest came and prayed
1561 Apollo that the Achaeans might take Troy and have a safe return if
1562 Agamemnon would only give him back his daughter; and the other Greeks
1563 assented, but Agamemnon was wroth, and so on--The whole then becomes
1564 descriptive, and the poet is the only speaker left; or, if you omit the
1565 narrative, the whole becomes dialogue. These are the three styles--which
1566 of them is to be admitted into our State? 'Do you ask whether tragedy
1567 and comedy are to be admitted?' Yes, but also something more--Is it not
1568 doubtful whether our guardians are to be imitators at all? Or rather,
1569 has not the question been already answered, for we have decided that one
1570 man cannot in his life play many parts, any more than he can act both
1571 tragedy and comedy, or be rhapsodist and actor at once? Human nature
1572 is coined into very small pieces, and as our guardians have their own
1573 business already, which is the care of freedom, they will have enough
1574 to do without imitating. If they imitate they should imitate, not any
1575 meanness or baseness, but the good only; for the mask which the actor
1576 wears is apt to become his face. We cannot allow men to play the parts
1577 of women, quarrelling, weeping, scolding, or boasting against the
1578 gods,--least of all when making love or in labour. They must not
1579 represent slaves, or bullies, or cowards, drunkards, or madmen, or
1580 blacksmiths, or neighing horses, or bellowing bulls, or sounding rivers,
1581 or a raging sea. A good or wise man will be willing to perform good and
1582 wise actions, but he will be ashamed to play an inferior part which he
1583 has never practised; and he will prefer to employ the descriptive style
1584 with as little imitation as possible. The man who has no self-respect,
1585 on the contrary, will imitate anybody and anything; sounds of nature
1586 and cries of animals alike; his whole performance will be imitation of
1587 gesture and voice. Now in the descriptive style there are few changes,
1588 but in the dramatic there are a great many. Poets and musicians use
1589 either, or a compound of both, and this compound is very attractive
1590 to youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar. But our State in
1591 which one man plays one part only is not adapted for complexity. And
1592 when one of these polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen offers to exhibit
1593 himself and his poetry we will show him every observance of respect,
1594 but at the same time tell him that there is no room for his kind in our
1595 State; we prefer the rough, honest poet, and will not depart from our
1596 original models (Laws).
1597 
1598 Next as to the music. A song or ode has three parts,--the subject, the
1599 harmony, and the rhythm; of which the two last are dependent upon the
1600 first. As we banished strains of lamentation, so we may now banish the
1601 mixed Lydian harmonies, which are the harmonies of lamentation; and
1602 as our citizens are to be temperate, we may also banish convivial
1603 harmonies, such as the Ionian and pure Lydian. Two remain--the
1604 Dorian and Phrygian, the first for war, the second for peace; the
1605 one expressive of courage, the other of obedience or instruction or
1606 religious feeling. And as we reject varieties of harmony, we shall
1607 also reject the many-stringed, variously-shaped instruments which give
1608 utterance to them, and in particular the flute, which is more complex
1609 than any of them. The lyre and the harp may be permitted in the town,
1610 and the Pan's-pipe in the fields. Thus we have made a purgation of
1611 music, and will now make a purgation of metres. These should be like the
1612 harmonies, simple and suitable to the occasion. There are four notes
1613 of the tetrachord, and there are three ratios of metre, 3/2, 2/2,
1614 2/1, which have all their characteristics, and the feet have different
1615 characteristics as well as the rhythms. But about this you and I must
1616 ask Damon, the great musician, who speaks, if I remember rightly, of a
1617 martial measure as well as of dactylic, trochaic, and iambic rhythms,
1618 which he arranges so as to equalize the syllables with one another,
1619 assigning to each the proper quantity. We only venture to affirm the
1620 general principle that the style is to conform to the subject and the
1621 metre to the style; and that the simplicity and harmony of the soul
1622 should be reflected in them all. This principle of simplicity has to
1623 be learnt by every one in the days of his youth, and may be gathered
1624 anywhere, from the creative and constructive arts, as well as from the
1625 forms of plants and animals.
1626 
1627 Other artists as well as poets should be warned against meanness or
1628 unseemliness. Sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to
1629 the law of simplicity. He who violates it cannot be allowed to work in
1630 our city, and to corrupt the taste of our citizens. For our guardians
1631 must grow up, not amid images of deformity which will gradually poison
1632 and corrupt their souls, but in a land of health and beauty where they
1633 will drink in from every object sweet and harmonious influences. And of
1634 all these influences the greatest is the education given by music,
1635 which finds a way into the innermost soul and imparts to it the sense
1636 of beauty and of deformity. At first the effect is unconscious; but when
1637 reason arrives, then he who has been thus trained welcomes her as the
1638 friend whom he always knew. As in learning to read, first we acquire the
1639 elements or letters separately, and afterwards their combinations,
1640 and cannot recognize reflections of them until we know the letters
1641 themselves;--in like manner we must first attain the elements or
1642 essential forms of the virtues, and then trace their combinations in
1643 life and experience. There is a music of the soul which answers to the
1644 harmony of the world; and the fairest object of a musical soul is the
1645 fair mind in the fair body. Some defect in the latter may be excused,
1646 but not in the former. True love is the daughter of temperance, and
1647 temperance is utterly opposed to the madness of bodily pleasure. Enough
1648 has been said of music, which makes a fair ending with love.
1649 
1650 Next we pass on to gymnastics; about which I would remark, that the
1651 soul is related to the body as a cause to an effect, and therefore if we
1652 educate the mind we may leave the education of the body in her charge,
1653 and need only give a general outline of the course to be pursued. In
1654 the first place the guardians must abstain from strong drink, for they
1655 should be the last persons to lose their wits. Whether the habits of
1656 the palaestra are suitable to them is more doubtful, for the ordinary
1657 gymnastic is a sleepy sort of thing, and if left off suddenly is apt to
1658 endanger health. But our warrior athletes must be wide-awake dogs, and
1659 must also be inured to all changes of food and climate. Hence they will
1660 require a simpler kind of gymnastic, akin to their simple music; and for
1661 their diet a rule may be found in Homer, who feeds his heroes on roast
1662 meat only, and gives them no fish although they are living at the
1663 sea-side, nor boiled meats which involve an apparatus of pots and pans;
1664 and, if I am not mistaken, he nowhere mentions sweet sauces. Sicilian
1665 cookery and Attic confections and Corinthian courtezans, which are
1666 to gymnastic what Lydian and Ionian melodies are to music, must be
1667 forbidden. Where gluttony and intemperance prevail the town quickly
1668 fills with doctors and pleaders; and law and medicine give themselves
1669 airs as soon as the freemen of a State take an interest in them. But
1670 what can show a more disgraceful state of education than to have to go
1671 abroad for justice because you have none of your own at home? And yet
1672 there IS a worse stage of the same disease--when men have learned
1673 to take a pleasure and pride in the twists and turns of the law; not
1674 considering how much better it would be for them so to order their lives
1675 as to have no need of a nodding justice. And there is a like disgrace in
1676 employing a physician, not for the cure of wounds or epidemic disorders,
1677 but because a man has by laziness and luxury contracted diseases
1678 which were unknown in the days of Asclepius. How simple is the Homeric
1679 practice of medicine. Eurypylus after he has been wounded drinks a
1680 posset of Pramnian wine, which is of a heating nature; and yet the
1681 sons of Asclepius blame neither the damsel who gives him the drink, nor
1682 Patroclus who is attending on him. The truth is that this modern system
1683 of nursing diseases was introduced by Herodicus the trainer; who,
1684 being of a sickly constitution, by a compound of training and medicine
1685 tortured first himself and then a good many other people, and lived
1686 a great deal longer than he had any right. But Asclepius would not
1687 practise this art, because he knew that the citizens of a well-ordered
1688 State have no leisure to be ill, and therefore he adopted the 'kill
1689 or cure' method, which artisans and labourers employ. 'They must be
1690 at their business,' they say, 'and have no time for coddling: if they
1691 recover, well; if they don't, there is an end of them.' Whereas the rich
1692 man is supposed to be a gentleman who can afford to be ill. Do you know
1693 a maxim of Phocylides--that 'when a man begins to be rich' (or, perhaps,
1694 a little sooner) 'he should practise virtue'? But how can excessive
1695 care of health be inconsistent with an ordinary occupation, and yet
1696 consistent with that practice of virtue which Phocylides inculcates?
1697 When a student imagines that philosophy gives him a headache, he never
1698 does anything; he is always unwell. This was the reason why Asclepius
1699 and his sons practised no such art. They were acting in the interest of
1700 the public, and did not wish to preserve useless lives, or raise up a
1701 puny offspring to wretched sires. Honest diseases they honestly cured;
1702 and if a man was wounded, they applied the proper remedies, and then let
1703 him eat and drink what he liked. But they declined to treat intemperate
1704 and worthless subjects, even though they might have made large fortunes
1705 out of them. As to the story of Pindar, that Asclepius was slain by a
1706 thunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life, that is a lie--following
1707 our old rule we must say either that he did not take bribes, or that he
1708 was not the son of a god.
1709 
1710 Glaucon then asks Socrates whether the best physicians and the best
1711 judges will not be those who have had severally the greatest experience
1712 of diseases and of crimes. Socrates draws a distinction between the two
1713 professions. The physician should have had experience of disease in
1714 his own body, for he cures with his mind and not with his body. But
1715 the judge controls mind by mind; and therefore his mind should not be
1716 corrupted by crime. Where then is he to gain experience? How is he to be
1717 wise and also innocent? When young a good man is apt to be deceived by
1718 evil-doers, because he has no pattern of evil in himself; and therefore
1719 the judge should be of a certain age; his youth should have been
1720 innocent, and he should have acquired insight into evil not by the
1721 practice of it, but by the observation of it in others. This is
1722 the ideal of a judge; the criminal turned detective is wonderfully
1723 suspicious, but when in company with good men who have experience, he is
1724 at fault, for he foolishly imagines that every one is as bad as himself.
1725 Vice may be known of virtue, but cannot know virtue. This is the sort of
1726 medicine and this the sort of law which will prevail in our State; they
1727 will be healing arts to better natures; but the evil body will be left
1728 to die by the one, and the evil soul will be put to death by the other.
1729 And the need of either will be greatly diminished by good music which
1730 will give harmony to the soul, and good gymnastic which will give
1731 health to the body. Not that this division of music and gymnastic really
1732 corresponds to soul and body; for they are both equally concerned with
1733 the soul, which is tamed by the one and aroused and sustained by the
1734 other. The two together supply our guardians with their twofold nature.
1735 The passionate disposition when it has too much gymnastic is hardened
1736 and brutalized, the gentle or philosophic temper which has too much
1737 music becomes enervated. While a man is allowing music to pour like
1738 water through the funnel of his ears, the edge of his soul gradually
1739 wears away, and the passionate or spirited element is melted out of
1740 him. Too little spirit is easily exhausted; too much quickly passes into
1741 nervous irritability. So, again, the athlete by feeding and training has
1742 his courage doubled, but he soon grows stupid; he is like a wild beast,
1743 ready to do everything by blows and nothing by counsel or policy. There
1744 are two principles in man, reason and passion, and to these, not to the
1745 soul and body, the two arts of music and gymnastic correspond. He who
1746 mingles them in harmonious concord is the true musician,--he shall be
1747 the presiding genius of our State.
1748 
1749 The next question is, Who are to be our rulers? First, the elder must
1750 rule the younger; and the best of the elders will be the best guardians.
1751 Now they will be the best who love their subjects most, and think that
1752 they have a common interest with them in the welfare of the state. These
1753 we must select; but they must be watched at every epoch of life to see
1754 whether they have retained the same opinions and held out against force
1755 and enchantment. For time and persuasion and the love of pleasure may
1756 enchant a man into a change of purpose, and the force of grief and pain
1757 may compel him. And therefore our guardians must be men who have been
1758 tried by many tests, like gold in the refiner's fire, and have been
1759 passed first through danger, then through pleasure, and at every age
1760 have come out of such trials victorious and without stain, in full
1761 command of themselves and their principles; having all their faculties
1762 in harmonious exercise for their country's good. These shall receive the
1763 highest honours both in life and death. (It would perhaps be better to
1764 confine the term 'guardians' to this select class: the younger men may
1765 be called 'auxiliaries.')
1766 
1767 And now for one magnificent lie, in the belief of which, Oh that we
1768 could train our rulers!--at any rate let us make the attempt with the
1769 rest of the world. What I am going to tell is only another version of
1770 the legend of Cadmus; but our unbelieving generation will be slow to
1771 accept such a story. The tale must be imparted, first to the rulers,
1772 then to the soldiers, lastly to the people. We will inform them that
1773 their youth was a dream, and that during the time when they seemed to
1774 be undergoing their education they were really being fashioned in the
1775 earth, who sent them up when they were ready; and that they must protect
1776 and cherish her whose children they are, and regard each other as
1777 brothers and sisters. 'I do not wonder at your being ashamed to propound
1778 such a fiction.' There is more behind. These brothers and sisters
1779 have different natures, and some of them God framed to rule, whom he
1780 fashioned of gold; others he made of silver, to be auxiliaries; others
1781 again to be husbandmen and craftsmen, and these were formed by him of
1782 brass and iron. But as they are all sprung from a common stock, a golden
1783 parent may have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden son, and then
1784 there must be a change of rank; the son of the rich must descend, and
1785 the child of the artisan rise, in the social scale; for an oracle says
1786 'that the State will come to an end if governed by a man of brass or
1787 iron.' Will our citizens ever believe all this? 'Not in the present
1788 generation, but in the next, perhaps, Yes.'
1789 
1790 Now let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their rulers,
1791 and look about and pitch their camp in a high place, which will be safe
1792 against enemies from without, and likewise against insurrections from
1793 within. There let them sacrifice and set up their tents; for soldiers
1794 they are to be and not shopkeepers, the watchdogs and guardians of the
1795 sheep; and luxury and avarice will turn them into wolves and tyrants.
1796 Their habits and their dwellings should correspond to their education.
1797 They should have no property; their pay should only meet their expenses;
1798 and they should have common meals. Gold and silver we will tell them
1799 that they have from God, and this divine gift in their souls they must
1800 not alloy with that earthly dross which passes under the name of gold.
1801 They only of the citizens may not touch it, or be under the same roof
1802 with it, or drink from it; it is the accursed thing. Should they
1803 ever acquire houses or lands or money of their own, they will become
1804 householders and tradesmen instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants
1805 instead of helpers, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves and the
1806 rest of the State, will be at hand.
1807 
1808 The religious and ethical aspect of Plato's education will hereafter
1809 be considered under a separate head. Some lesser points may be more
1810 conveniently noticed in this place.
1811 
1812 1. The constant appeal to the authority of Homer, whom, with grave
1813 irony, Plato, after the manner of his age, summons as a witness about
1814 ethics and psychology, as well as about diet and medicine; attempting
1815 to distinguish the better lesson from the worse, sometimes altering
1816 the text from design; more than once quoting or alluding to Homer
1817 inaccurately, after the manner of the early logographers turning the
1818 Iliad into prose, and delighting to draw far-fetched inferences from
1819 his words, or to make ludicrous applications of them. He does not, like
1820 Heracleitus, get into a rage with Homer and Archilochus (Heracl.), but
1821 uses their words and expressions as vehicles of a higher truth; not on
1822 a system like Theagenes of Rhegium or Metrodorus, or in later times the
1823 Stoics, but as fancy may dictate. And the conclusions drawn from them
1824 are sound, although the premises are fictitious. These fanciful appeals
1825 to Homer add a charm to Plato's style, and at the same time they have
1826 the effect of a satire on the follies of Homeric interpretation. To us
1827 (and probably to himself), although they take the form of arguments,
1828 they are really figures of speech. They may be compared with modern
1829 citations from Scripture, which have often a great rhetorical power even
1830 when the original meaning of the words is entirely lost sight of. The
1831 real, like the Platonic Socrates, as we gather from the Memorabilia of
1832 Xenophon, was fond of making similar adaptations. Great in all ages and
1833 countries, in religion as well as in law and literature, has been the
1834 art of interpretation.
1835 
1836 2. 'The style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style.'
1837 Notwithstanding the fascination which the word 'classical' exercises
1838 over us, we can hardly maintain that this rule is observed in all the
1839 Greek poetry which has come down to us. We cannot deny that the thought
1840 often exceeds the power of lucid expression in Aeschylus and Pindar;
1841 or that rhetoric gets the better of the thought in the Sophist-poet
1842 Euripides. Only perhaps in Sophocles is there a perfect harmony of the
1843 two; in him alone do we find a grace of language like the beauty of a
1844 Greek statue, in which there is nothing to add or to take away; at
1845 least this is true of single plays or of large portions of them. The
1846 connection in the Tragic Choruses and in the Greek lyric poets is not
1847 unfrequently a tangled thread which in an age before logic the poet was
1848 unable to draw out. Many thoughts and feelings mingled in his mind, and
1849 he had no power of disengaging or arranging them. For there is a subtle
1850 influence of logic which requires to be transferred from prose to
1851 poetry, just as the music and perfection of language are infused by
1852 poetry into prose. In all ages the poet has been a bad judge of his
1853 own meaning (Apol.); for he does not see that the word which is full
1854 of associations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of
1855 another; or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to
1856 others. There are many passages in some of our greatest modern poets
1857 which are far too obscure; in which there is no proportion between style
1858 and subject, in which any half-expressed figure, any harsh construction,
1859 any distorted collocation of words, any remote sequence of ideas is
1860 admitted; and there is no voice 'coming sweetly from nature,' or music
1861 adding the expression of feeling to thought. As if there could be poetry
1862 without beauty, or beauty without ease and clearness. The obscurities
1863 of early Greek poets arose necessarily out of the state of language and
1864 logic which existed in their age. They are not examples to be followed
1865 by us; for the use of language ought in every generation to become
1866 clearer and clearer. Like Shakespere, they were great in spite, not
1867 in consequence, of their imperfections of expression. But there is no
1868 reason for returning to the necessary obscurity which prevailed in
1869 the infancy of literature. The English poets of the last century were
1870 certainly not obscure; and we have no excuse for losing what they had
1871 gained, or for going back to the earlier or transitional age which
1872 preceded them. The thought of our own times has not out-stripped
1873 language; a want of Plato's 'art of measuring' is the rule cause of the
1874 disproportion between them.
1875 
1876 3. In the third book of the Republic a nearer approach is made to a
1877 theory of art than anywhere else in Plato. His views may be summed up
1878 as follows:--True art is not fanciful and imitative, but simple and
1879 ideal,--the expression of the highest moral energy, whether in action or
1880 repose. To live among works of plastic art which are of this noble
1881 and simple character, or to listen to such strains, is the best of
1882 influences,--the true Greek atmosphere, in which youth should be brought
1883 up. That is the way to create in them a natural good taste, which will
1884 have a feeling of truth and beauty in all things. For though the
1885 poets are to be expelled, still art is recognized as another aspect of
1886 reason--like love in the Symposium, extending over the same sphere, but
1887 confined to the preliminary education, and acting through the power of
1888 habit; and this conception of art is not limited to strains of music or
1889 the forms of plastic art, but pervades all nature and has a wide kindred
1890 in the world. The Republic of Plato, like the Athens of Pericles, has an
1891 artistic as well as a political side.
1892 
1893 There is hardly any mention in Plato of the creative arts; only in two
1894 or three passages does he even allude to them (Rep.; Soph.). He is
1895 not lost in rapture at the great works of Phidias, the Parthenon, the
1896 Propylea, the statues of Zeus or Athene. He would probably have regarded
1897 any abstract truth of number or figure as higher than the greatest of
1898 them. Yet it is hard to suppose that some influence, such as he hopes to
1899 inspire in youth, did not pass into his own mind from the works of art
1900 which he saw around him. We are living upon the fragments of them, and
1901 find in a few broken stones the standard of truth and beauty. But in
1902 Plato this feeling has no expression; he nowhere says that beauty is the
1903 object of art; he seems to deny that wisdom can take an external form
1904 (Phaedrus); he does not distinguish the fine from the mechanical arts.
1905 Whether or no, like some writers, he felt more than he expressed, it
1906 is at any rate remarkable that the greatest perfection of the fine arts
1907 should coincide with an almost entire silence about them. In one very
1908 striking passage he tells us that a work of art, like the State, is a
1909 whole; and this conception of a whole and the love of the newly-born
1910 mathematical sciences may be regarded, if not as the inspiring, at any
1911 rate as the regulating principles of Greek art (Xen. Mem.; and Sophist).
1912 
1913 4. Plato makes the true and subtle remark that the physician had better
1914 not be in robust health; and should have known what illness is in his
1915 own person. But the judge ought to have had no similar experience of
1916 evil; he is to be a good man who, having passed his youth in innocence,
1917 became acquainted late in life with the vices of others. And therefore,
1918 according to Plato, a judge should not be young, just as a young man
1919 according to Aristotle is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophy.
1920 The bad, on the other hand, have a knowledge of vice, but no knowledge
1921 of virtue. It may be doubted, however, whether this train of reflection
1922 is well founded. In a remarkable passage of the Laws it is acknowledged
1923 that the evil may form a correct estimate of the good. The union of
1924 gentleness and courage in Book ii. at first seemed to be a paradox,
1925 yet was afterwards ascertained to be a truth. And Plato might also have
1926 found that the intuition of evil may be consistent with the abhorrence
1927 of it. There is a directness of aim in virtue which gives an insight
1928 into vice. And the knowledge of character is in some degree a natural
1929 sense independent of any special experience of good or evil.
1930 
1931 5. One of the most remarkable conceptions of Plato, because un-Greek and
1932 also very different from anything which existed at all in his age of
1933 the world, is the transposition of ranks. In the Spartan state there had
1934 been enfranchisement of Helots and degradation of citizens under
1935 special circumstances. And in the ancient Greek aristocracies, merit
1936 was certainly recognized as one of the elements on which government was
1937 based. The founders of states were supposed to be their benefactors, who
1938 were raised by their great actions above the ordinary level of humanity;
1939 at a later period, the services of warriors and legislators were held to
1940 entitle them and their descendants to the privileges of citizenship and
1941 to the first rank in the state. And although the existence of an ideal
1942 aristocracy is slenderly proven from the remains of early Greek history,
1943 and we have a difficulty in ascribing such a character, however the idea
1944 may be defined, to any actual Hellenic state--or indeed to any state
1945 which has ever existed in the world--still the rule of the best was
1946 certainly the aspiration of philosophers, who probably accommodated a
1947 good deal their views of primitive history to their own notions of good
1948 government. Plato further insists on applying to the guardians of his
1949 state a series of tests by which all those who fell short of a fixed
1950 standard were either removed from the governing body, or not admitted
1951 to it; and this 'academic' discipline did to a certain extent prevail in
1952 Greek states, especially in Sparta. He also indicates that the system of
1953 caste, which existed in a great part of the ancient, and is by no means
1954 extinct in the modern European world, should be set aside from time
1955 to time in favour of merit. He is aware how deeply the greater part of
1956 mankind resent any interference with the order of society, and therefore
1957 he proposes his novel idea in the form of what he himself calls a
1958 'monstrous fiction.' (Compare the ceremony of preparation for the two
1959 'great waves' in Book v.) Two principles are indicated by him: first,
1960 that there is a distinction of ranks dependent on circumstances prior to
1961 the individual: second, that this distinction is and ought to be broken
1962 through by personal qualities. He adapts mythology like the Homeric
1963 poems to the wants of the state, making 'the Phoenician tale' the
1964 vehicle of his ideas. Every Greek state had a myth respecting its own
1965 origin; the Platonic republic may also have a tale of earthborn men. The
1966 gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is told, and the analogy
1967 of Greek tradition, are a sufficient verification of the 'monstrous
1968 falsehood.' Ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and silver and brass and
1969 iron age succeeding one another, but Plato supposes these differences
1970 in the natures of men to exist together in a single state. Mythology
1971 supplies a figure under which the lesson may be taught (as Protagoras
1972 says, 'the myth is more interesting'), and also enables Plato to touch
1973 lightly on new principles without going into details. In this passage he
1974 shadows forth a general truth, but he does not tell us by what steps the
1975 transposition of ranks is to be effected. Indeed throughout the Republic
1976 he allows the lower ranks to fade into the distance. We do not know
1977 whether they are to carry arms, and whether in the fifth book they are
1978 or are not included in the communistic regulations respecting property
1979 and marriage. Nor is there any use in arguing strictly either from a
1980 few chance words, or from the silence of Plato, or in drawing inferences
1981 which were beyond his vision. Aristotle, in his criticism on the
1982 position of the lower classes, does not perceive that the poetical
1983 creation is 'like the air, invulnerable,' and cannot be penetrated by
1984 the shafts of his logic (Pol.).
1985 
1986 6. Two paradoxes which strike the modern reader as in the highest degree
1987 fanciful and ideal, and which suggest to him many reflections, are to
1988 be found in the third book of the Republic: first, the great power of
1989 music, so much beyond any influence which is experienced by us in modern
1990 times, when the art or science has been far more developed, and has
1991 found the secret of harmony, as well as of melody; secondly, the
1992 indefinite and almost absolute control which the soul is supposed to
1993 exercise over the body.
1994 
1995 In the first we suspect some degree of exaggeration, such as we may
1996 also observe among certain masters of the art, not unknown to us, at the
1997 present day. With this natural enthusiasm, which is felt by a few only,
1998 there seems to mingle in Plato a sort of Pythagorean reverence for
1999 numbers and numerical proportion to which Aristotle is a stranger.
2000 Intervals of sound and number are to him sacred things which have a law
2001 of their own, not dependent on the variations of sense. They rise above
2002 sense, and become a connecting link with the world of ideas. But it is
2003 evident that Plato is describing what to him appears to be also a fact.
2004 The power of a simple and characteristic melody on the impressible
2005 mind of the Greek is more than we can easily appreciate. The effect of
2006 national airs may bear some comparison with it. And, besides all this,
2007 there is a confusion between the harmony of musical notes and the
2008 harmony of soul and body, which is so potently inspired by them.
2009 
2010 The second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting
2011 questions--How far can the mind control the body? Is the relation
2012 between them one of mutual antagonism or of mutual harmony? Are they
2013 two or one, and is either of them the cause of the other? May we not at
2014 times drop the opposition between them, and the mode of describing them,
2015 which is so familiar to us, and yet hardly conveys any precise meaning,
2016 and try to view this composite creature, man, in a more simple manner?
2017 Must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a higher
2018 and a lower principle, divided by no distinct line, which at times
2019 break asunder and take up arms against one another? Or again, they are
2020 reconciled and move together, either unconsciously in the ordinary work
2021 of life, or consciously in the pursuit of some noble aim, to be attained
2022 not without an effort, and for which every thought and nerve are
2023 strained. And then the body becomes the good friend or ally, or servant
2024 or instrument of the mind. And the mind has often a wonderful and almost
2025 superhuman power of banishing disease and weakness and calling out a
2026 hidden strength. Reason and the desires, the intellect and the senses
2027 are brought into harmony and obedience so as to form a single human
2028 being. They are ever parting, ever meeting; and the identity or
2029 diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the most part
2030 unnoticed by us. When the mind touches the body through the appetites,
2031 we acknowledge the responsibility of the one to the other. There is a
2032 tendency in us which says 'Drink.' There is another which says, 'Do
2033 not drink; it is not good for you.' And we all of us know which is the
2034 rightful superior. We are also responsible for our health, although into
2035 this sphere there enter some elements of necessity which may be beyond
2036 our control. Still even in the management of health, care and thought,
2037 continued over many years, may make us almost free agents, if we do
2038 not exact too much of ourselves, and if we acknowledge that all human
2039 freedom is limited by the laws of nature and of mind.
2040 
2041 We are disappointed to find that Plato, in the general condemnation
2042 which he passes on the practice of medicine prevailing in his own day,
2043 depreciates the effects of diet. He would like to have diseases of a
2044 definite character and capable of receiving a definite treatment. He is
2045 afraid of invalidism interfering with the business of life. He does
2046 not recognize that time is the great healer both of mental and bodily
2047 disorders; and that remedies which are gradual and proceed little by
2048 little are safer than those which produce a sudden catastrophe. Neither
2049 does he see that there is no way in which the mind can more surely
2050 influence the body than by the control of eating and drinking; or any
2051 other action or occasion of human life on which the higher freedom of
2052 the will can be more simple or truly asserted.
2053 
2054 7. Lesser matters of style may be remarked.
2055 
2056 (1) The affected ignorance of music, which is Plato's way of expressing
2057 that he is passing lightly over the subject.
2058 
2059 (2) The tentative manner in which here, as in the second book, he
2060 proceeds with the construction of the State.
2061 
2062 (3) The description of the State sometimes as a reality, and then again
2063 as a work of imagination only; these are the arts by which he sustains
2064 the reader's interest.
2065 
2066 (4) Connecting links, or the preparation for the entire expulsion of the
2067 poets in Book X.
2068 
2069 (5) The companion pictures of the lover of litigation and the
2070 valetudinarian, the satirical jest about the maxim of Phocylides, the
2071 manner in which the image of the gold and silver citizens is taken
2072 up into the subject, and the argument from the practice of Asclepius,
2073 should not escape notice.
2074 
2075 BOOK IV. Adeimantus said: 'Suppose a person to argue, Socrates, that you
2076 make your citizens miserable, and this by their own free-will; they are
2077 the lords of the city, and yet instead of having, like other men, lands
2078 and houses and money of their own, they live as mercenaries and are
2079 always mounting guard.' You may add, I replied, that they receive no
2080 pay but only their food, and have no money to spend on a journey or a
2081 mistress. 'Well, and what answer do you give?' My answer is, that
2082 our guardians may or may not be the happiest of men,--I should not be
2083 surprised to find in the long-run that they were,--but this is not the
2084 aim of our constitution, which was designed for the good of the whole
2085 and not of any one part. If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for
2086 having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not
2087 purple but black, he would reply: 'The eye must be an eye, and you
2088 should look at the statue as a whole.' 'Now I can well imagine a fool's
2089 paradise, in which everybody is eating and drinking, clothed in purple
2090 and fine linen, and potters lie on sofas and have their wheel at hand,
2091 that they may work a little when they please; and cobblers and all the
2092 other classes of a State lose their distinctive character. And a State
2093 may get on without cobblers; but when the guardians degenerate into boon
2094 companions, then the ruin is complete. Remember that we are not talking
2095 of peasants keeping holiday, but of a State in which every man is
2096 expected to do his own work. The happiness resides not in this or that
2097 class, but in the State as a whole. I have another remark to make:--A
2098 middle condition is best for artisans; they should have money enough to
2099 buy tools, and not enough to be independent of business. And will not
2100 the same condition be best for our citizens? If they are poor, they will
2101 be mean; if rich, luxurious and lazy; and in neither case contented.
2102 'But then how will our poor city be able to go to war against an enemy
2103 who has money?' There may be a difficulty in fighting against one enemy;
2104 against two there will be none. In the first place, the contest will be
2105 carried on by trained warriors against well-to-do citizens: and is not a
2106 regular athlete an easy match for two stout opponents at least? Suppose
2107 also, that before engaging we send ambassadors to one of the two cities,
2108 saying, 'Silver and gold we have not; do you help us and take our share
2109 of the spoil;'--who would fight against the lean, wiry dogs, when they
2110 might join with them in preying upon the fatted sheep? 'But if many
2111 states join their resources, shall we not be in danger?' I am amused
2112 to hear you use the word 'state' of any but our own State. They are
2113 'states,' but not 'a state'--many in one. For in every state there are
2114 two hostile nations, rich and poor, which you may set one against the
2115 other. But our State, while she remains true to her principles, will be
2116 in very deed the mightiest of Hellenic states.
2117 
2118 To the size of the state there is no limit but the necessity of unity;
2119 it must be neither too large nor too small to be one. This is a matter
2120 of secondary importance, like the principle of transposition which was
2121 intimated in the parable of the earthborn men. The meaning there implied
2122 was that every man should do that for which he was fitted, and be at
2123 one with himself, and then the whole city would be united. But all these
2124 things are secondary, if education, which is the great matter, be duly
2125 regarded. When the wheel has once been set in motion, the speed is
2126 always increasing; and each generation improves upon the preceding, both
2127 in physical and moral qualities. The care of the governors should be
2128 directed to preserve music and gymnastic from innovation; alter the
2129 songs of a country, Damon says, and you will soon end by altering its
2130 laws. The change appears innocent at first, and begins in play; but
2131 the evil soon becomes serious, working secretly upon the characters of
2132 individuals, then upon social and commercial relations, and lastly upon
2133 the institutions of a state; and there is ruin and confusion everywhere.
2134 But if education remains in the established form, there will be no
2135 danger. A restorative process will be always going on; the spirit of law
2136 and order will raise up what has fallen down. Nor will any regulations
2137 be needed for the lesser matters of life--rules of deportment or
2138 fashions of dress. Like invites like for good or for evil. Education
2139 will correct deficiencies and supply the power of self-government. Far
2140 be it from us to enter into the particulars of legislation; let the
2141 guardians take care of education, and education will take care of all
2142 other things.
2143 
2144 But without education they may patch and mend as they please; they will
2145 make no progress, any more than a patient who thinks to cure himself by
2146 some favourite remedy and will not give up his luxurious mode of living.
2147 If you tell such persons that they must first alter their habits, then
2148 they grow angry; they are charming people. 'Charming,--nay, the very
2149 reverse.' Evidently these gentlemen are not in your good graces, nor the
2150 state which is like them. And such states there are which first ordain
2151 under penalty of death that no one shall alter the constitution, and
2152 then suffer themselves to be flattered into and out of anything; and
2153 he who indulges them and fawns upon them, is their leader and saviour.
2154 'Yes, the men are as bad as the states.' But do you not admire their
2155 cleverness? 'Nay, some of them are stupid enough to believe what the
2156 people tell them.' And when all the world is telling a man that he is
2157 six feet high, and he has no measure, how can he believe anything
2158 else? But don't get into a passion: to see our statesmen trying their
2159 nostrums, and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the Hydra-like
2160 rogueries of mankind, is as good as a play. Minute enactments are
2161 superfluous in good states, and are useless in bad ones.
2162 
2163 And now what remains of the work of legislation? Nothing for us; but to
2164 Apollo the god of Delphi we leave the ordering of the greatest of all
2165 things--that is to say, religion. Only our ancestral deity sitting upon
2166 the centre and navel of the earth will be trusted by us if we have any
2167 sense, in an affair of such magnitude. No foreign god shall be supreme
2168 in our realms...
2169 
2170 Here, as Socrates would say, let us 'reflect on' (Greek) what has
2171 preceded: thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens,
2172 but only of the well-being of the State. They may be the happiest of
2173 men, but our principal aim in founding the State was not to make them
2174 happy. They were to be guardians, not holiday-makers. In this pleasant
2175 manner is presented to us the famous question both of ancient and modern
2176 philosophy, touching the relation of duty to happiness, of right to
2177 utility.
2178 
2179 First duty, then happiness, is the natural order of our moral ideas. The
2180 utilitarian principle is valuable as a corrective of error, and shows
2181 to us a side of ethics which is apt to be neglected. It may be admitted
2182 further that right and utility are co-extensive, and that he who makes
2183 the happiness of mankind his object has one of the highest and noblest
2184 motives of human action. But utility is not the historical basis of
2185 morality; nor the aspect in which moral and religious ideas commonly
2186 occur to the mind. The greatest happiness of all is, as we believe, the
2187 far-off result of the divine government of the universe. The greatest
2188 happiness of the individual is certainly to be found in a life of virtue
2189 and goodness. But we seem to be more assured of a law of right than we
2190 can be of a divine purpose, that 'all mankind should be saved;' and
2191 we infer the one from the other. And the greatest happiness of the
2192 individual may be the reverse of the greatest happiness in the ordinary
2193 sense of the term, and may be realised in a life of pain, or in a
2194 voluntary death. Further, the word 'happiness' has several ambiguities;
2195 it may mean either pleasure or an ideal life, happiness subjective or
2196 objective, in this world or in another, of ourselves only or of
2197 our neighbours and of all men everywhere. By the modern founder of
2198 Utilitarianism the self-regarding and disinterested motives of action
2199 are included under the same term, although they are commonly opposed
2200 by us as benevolence and self-love. The word happiness has not the
2201 definiteness or the sacredness of 'truth' and 'right'; it does
2202 not equally appeal to our higher nature, and has not sunk into the
2203 conscience of mankind. It is associated too much with the comforts and
2204 conveniences of life; too little with 'the goods of the soul which we
2205 desire for their own sake.' In a great trial, or danger, or temptation,
2206 or in any great and heroic action, it is scarcely thought of. For these
2207 reasons 'the greatest happiness' principle is not the true foundation of
2208 ethics. But though not the first principle, it is the second, which is
2209 like unto it, and is often of easier application. For the larger part of
2210 human actions are neither right nor wrong, except in so far as they tend
2211 to the happiness of mankind (Introd. to Gorgias and Philebus).
2212 
2213 The same question reappears in politics, where the useful or expedient
2214 seems to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater authority. For
2215 concerning political measures, we chiefly ask: How will they affect
2216 the happiness of mankind? Yet here too we may observe that what we term
2217 expediency is merely the law of right limited by the conditions of human
2218 society. Right and truth are the highest aims of government as well as
2219 of individuals; and we ought not to lose sight of them because we cannot
2220 directly enforce them. They appeal to the better mind of nations; and
2221 sometimes they are too much for merely temporal interests to resist.
2222 They are the watchwords which all men use in matters of public policy,
2223 as well as in their private dealings; the peace of Europe may be said
2224 to depend upon them. In the most commercial and utilitarian states
2225 of society the power of ideas remains. And all the higher class of
2226 statesmen have in them something of that idealism which Pericles is said
2227 to have gathered from the teaching of Anaxagoras. They recognise that
2228 the true leader of men must be above the motives of ambition, and
2229 that national character is of greater value than material comfort and
2230 prosperity. And this is the order of thought in Plato; first, he expects
2231 his citizens to do their duty, and then under favourable circumstances,
2232 that is to say, in a well-ordered State, their happiness is assured.
2233 That he was far from excluding the modern principle of utility in
2234 politics is sufficiently evident from other passages; in which 'the most
2235 beneficial is affirmed to be the most honourable', and also 'the most
2236 sacred'.
2237 
2238 We may note
2239 
2240 (1) The manner in which the objection of Adeimantus here, is designed to
2241 draw out and deepen the argument of Socrates.
2242 
2243 (2) The conception of a whole as lying at the foundation both of
2244 politics and of art, in the latter supplying the only principle of
2245 criticism, which, under the various names of harmony, symmetry, measure,
2246 proportion, unity, the Greek seems to have applied to works of art.
2247 
2248 (3) The requirement that the State should be limited in size, after the
2249 traditional model of a Greek state; as in the Politics of Aristotle, the
2250 fact that the cities of Hellas were small is converted into a principle.
2251 
2252 (4) The humorous pictures of the lean dogs and the fatted sheep, of
2253 the light active boxer upsetting two stout gentlemen at least, of the
2254 'charming' patients who are always making themselves worse; or again,
2255 the playful assumption that there is no State but our own; or the grave
2256 irony with which the statesman is excused who believes that he is six
2257 feet high because he is told so, and having nothing to measure with
2258 is to be pardoned for his ignorance--he is too amusing for us to be
2259 seriously angry with him.
2260 
2261 (5) The light and superficial manner in which religion is passed over
2262 when provision has been made for two great principles,--first, that
2263 religion shall be based on the highest conception of the gods, secondly,
2264 that the true national or Hellenic type shall be maintained...
2265 
2266 Socrates proceeds: But where amid all this is justice? Son of Ariston,
2267 tell me where. Light a candle and search the city, and get your brother
2268 and the rest of our friends to help in seeking for her. 'That won't do,'
2269 replied Glaucon, 'you yourself promised to make the search and talked
2270 about the impiety of deserting justice.' Well, I said, I will lead the
2271 way, but do you follow. My notion is, that our State being perfect will
2272 contain all the four virtues--wisdom, courage, temperance, justice. If
2273 we eliminate the three first, the unknown remainder will be justice.
2274 
2275 First then, of wisdom: the State which we have called into being will be
2276 wise because politic. And policy is one among many kinds of skill,--not
2277 the skill of the carpenter, or of the worker in metal, or of the
2278 husbandman, but the skill of him who advises about the interests of the
2279 whole State. Of such a kind is the skill of the guardians, who are a
2280 small class in number, far smaller than the blacksmiths; but in them
2281 is concentrated the wisdom of the State. And if this small ruling class
2282 have wisdom, then the whole State will be wise.
2283 
2284 Our second virtue is courage, which we have no difficulty in finding
2285 in another class--that of soldiers. Courage may be defined as a sort
2286 of salvation--the never-failing salvation of the opinions which law and
2287 education have prescribed concerning dangers. You know the way in which
2288 dyers first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple
2289 or of any other colour. Colours dyed in this way become fixed, and no
2290 soap or lye will ever wash them out. Now the ground is education, and
2291 the laws are the colours; and if the ground is properly laid, neither
2292 the soap of pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them
2293 out. This power which preserves right opinion about danger I would ask
2294 you to call 'courage,' adding the epithet 'political' or 'civilized'
2295 in order to distinguish it from mere animal courage and from a higher
2296 courage which may hereafter be discussed.
2297 
2298 Two virtues remain; temperance and justice. More than the preceding
2299 virtues temperance suggests the idea of harmony. Some light is thrown
2300 upon the nature of this virtue by the popular description of a man as
2301 'master of himself'--which has an absurd sound, because the master is
2302 also the servant. The expression really means that the better principle
2303 in a man masters the worse. There are in cities whole classes--women,
2304 slaves and the like--who correspond to the worse, and a few only to the
2305 better; and in our State the former class are held under control by the
2306 latter. Now to which of these classes does temperance belong? 'To both
2307 of them.' And our State if any will be the abode of temperance; and
2308 we were right in describing this virtue as a harmony which is diffused
2309 through the whole, making the dwellers in the city to be of one mind,
2310 and attuning the upper and middle and lower classes like the strings of
2311 an instrument, whether you suppose them to differ in wisdom, strength or
2312 wealth.
2313 
2314 And now we are near the spot; let us draw in and surround the cover and
2315 watch with all our eyes, lest justice should slip away and escape. Tell
2316 me, if you see the thicket move first. 'Nay, I would have you lead.'
2317 Well then, offer up a prayer and follow. The way is dark and difficult;
2318 but we must push on. I begin to see a track. 'Good news.' Why, Glaucon,
2319 our dulness of scent is quite ludicrous! While we are straining our eyes
2320 into the distance, justice is tumbling out at our feet. We are as bad
2321 as people looking for a thing which they have in their hands. Have you
2322 forgotten our old principle of the division of labour, or of every man
2323 doing his own business, concerning which we spoke at the foundation
2324 of the State--what but this was justice? Is there any other virtue
2325 remaining which can compete with wisdom and temperance and courage in
2326 the scale of political virtue? For 'every one having his own' is the
2327 great object of government; and the great object of trade is that
2328 every man should do his own business. Not that there is much harm in a
2329 carpenter trying to be a cobbler, or a cobbler transforming himself into
2330 a carpenter; but great evil may arise from the cobbler leaving his last
2331 and turning into a guardian or legislator, or when a single individual
2332 is trainer, warrior, legislator, all in one. And this evil is injustice,
2333 or every man doing another's business. I do not say that as yet we are
2334 in a condition to arrive at a final conclusion. For the definition
2335 which we believe to hold good in states has still to be tested by the
2336 individual. Having read the large letters we will now come back to the
2337 small. From the two together a brilliant light may be struck out...
2338 
2339 Socrates proceeds to discover the nature of justice by a method of
2340 residues. Each of the first three virtues corresponds to one of the
2341 three parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the State,
2342 although the third, temperance, has more of the nature of a harmony than
2343 the first two. If there be a fourth virtue, that can only be sought for
2344 in the relation of the three parts in the soul or classes in the State
2345 to one another. It is obvious and simple, and for that very reason has
2346 not been found out. The modern logician will be inclined to object that
2347 ideas cannot be separated like chemical substances, but that they run
2348 into one another and may be only different aspects or names of the
2349 same thing, and such in this instance appears to be the case. For the
2350 definition here given of justice is verbally the same as one of the
2351 definitions of temperance given by Socrates in the Charmides, which
2352 however is only provisional, and is afterwards rejected. And so far
2353 from justice remaining over when the other virtues are eliminated,
2354 the justice and temperance of the Republic can with difficulty be
2355 distinguished. Temperance appears to be the virtue of a part only, and
2356 one of three, whereas justice is a universal virtue of the whole soul.
2357 Yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a sort of harmony,
2358 and in this respect is akin to justice. Justice seems to differ from
2359 temperance in degree rather than in kind; whereas temperance is the
2360 harmony of discordant elements, justice is the perfect order by which
2361 all natures and classes do their own business, the right man in the
2362 right place, the division and co-operation of all the citizens. Justice,
2363 again, is a more abstract notion than the other virtues, and therefore,
2364 from Plato's point of view, the foundation of them, to which they
2365 are referred and which in idea precedes them. The proposal to omit
2366 temperance is a mere trick of style intended to avoid monotony.
2367 
2368 There is a famous question discussed in one of the earlier Dialogues of
2369 Plato (Protagoras; Arist. Nic. Ethics), 'Whether the virtues are one
2370 or many?' This receives an answer which is to the effect that there
2371 are four cardinal virtues (now for the first time brought together in
2372 ethical philosophy), and one supreme over the rest, which is not like
2373 Aristotle's conception of universal justice, virtue relative to others,
2374 but the whole of virtue relative to the parts. To this universal
2375 conception of justice or order in the first education and in the moral
2376 nature of man, the still more universal conception of the good in the
2377 second education and in the sphere of speculative knowledge seems to
2378 succeed. Both might be equally described by the terms 'law,' 'order,'
2379 'harmony;' but while the idea of good embraces 'all time and all
2380 existence,' the conception of justice is not extended beyond man.
2381 
2382 ...Socrates is now going to identify the individual and the State. But
2383 first he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul.
2384 His argument is as follows:--Quantity makes no difference in quality.
2385 The word 'just,' whether applied to the individual or to the State, has
2386 the same meaning. And the term 'justice' implied that the same three
2387 principles in the State and in the individual were doing their own
2388 business. But are they really three or one? The question is difficult,
2389 and one which can hardly be solved by the methods which we are now
2390 using; but the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time.
2391 'The shorter will satisfy me.' Well then, you would admit that the
2392 qualities of states mean the qualities of the individuals who compose
2393 them? The Scythians and Thracians are passionate, our own race
2394 intellectual, and the Egyptians and Phoenicians covetous, because
2395 the individual members of each have such and such a character; the
2396 difficulty is to determine whether the several principles are one or
2397 three; whether, that is to say, we reason with one part of our nature,
2398 desire with another, are angry with another, or whether the whole soul
2399 comes into play in each sort of action. This enquiry, however, requires
2400 a very exact definition of terms. The same thing in the same relation
2401 cannot be affected in two opposite ways. But there is no impossibility
2402 in a man standing still, yet moving his arms, or in a top which is fixed
2403 on one spot going round upon its axis. There is no necessity to mention
2404 all the possible exceptions; let us provisionally assume that opposites
2405 cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same relation. And to the
2406 class of opposites belong assent and dissent, desire and avoidance.
2407 And one form of desire is thirst and hunger: and here arises a new
2408 point--thirst is thirst of drink, hunger is hunger of food; not of warm
2409 drink or of a particular kind of food, with the single exception of
2410 course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it is
2411 good. When relative terms have no attributes, their correlatives have
2412 no attributes; when they have attributes, their correlatives also have
2413 them. For example, the term 'greater' is simply relative to 'less,' and
2414 knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge. But on the other hand, a
2415 particular knowledge is of a particular subject. Again, every science
2416 has a distinct character, which is defined by an object; medicine, for
2417 example, is the science of health, although not to be confounded with
2418 health. Having cleared our ideas thus far, let us return to the original
2419 instance of thirst, which has a definite object--drink. Now the thirsty
2420 soul may feel two distinct impulses; the animal one saying 'Drink;'
2421 the rational one, which says 'Do not drink.' The two impulses are
2422 contradictory; and therefore we may assume that they spring from
2423 distinct principles in the soul. But is passion a third principle, or
2424 akin to desire? There is a story of a certain Leontius which throws some
2425 light on this question. He was coming up from the Piraeus outside the
2426 north wall, and he passed a spot where there were dead bodies lying
2427 by the executioner. He felt a longing desire to see them and also an
2428 abhorrence of them; at first he turned away and shut his eyes, then,
2429 suddenly tearing them open, he said,--'Take your fill, ye wretches, of
2430 the fair sight.' Now is there not here a third principle which is often
2431 found to come to the assistance of reason against desire, but never
2432 of desire against reason? This is passion or spirit, of the separate
2433 existence of which we may further convince ourselves by putting the
2434 following case:--When a man suffers justly, if he be of a generous
2435 nature he is not indignant at the hardships which he undergoes: but when
2436 he suffers unjustly, his indignation is his great support; hunger and
2437 thirst cannot tame him; the spirit within him must do or die, until the
2438 voice of the shepherd, that is, of reason, bidding his dog bark no
2439 more, is heard within. This shows that passion is the ally of reason. Is
2440 passion then the same with reason? No, for the former exists in children
2441 and brutes; and Homer affords a proof of the distinction between them
2442 when he says, 'He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul.'
2443 
2444 And now, at last, we have reached firm ground, and are able to infer
2445 that the virtues of the State and of the individual are the same. For
2446 wisdom and courage and justice in the State are severally the wisdom and
2447 courage and justice in the individuals who form the State. Each of the
2448 three classes will do the work of its own class in the State, and each
2449 part in the individual soul; reason, the superior, and passion, the
2450 inferior, will be harmonized by the influence of music and gymnastic.
2451 The counsellor and the warrior, the head and the arm, will act together
2452 in the town of Mansoul, and keep the desires in proper subjection. The
2453 courage of the warrior is that quality which preserves a right opinion
2454 about dangers in spite of pleasures and pains. The wisdom of the
2455 counsellor is that small part of the soul which has authority and
2456 reason. The virtue of temperance is the friendship of the ruling and the
2457 subject principles, both in the State and in the individual. Of justice
2458 we have already spoken; and the notion already given of it may
2459 be confirmed by common instances. Will the just state or the just
2460 individual steal, lie, commit adultery, or be guilty of impiety to
2461 gods and men? 'No.' And is not the reason of this that the several
2462 principles, whether in the state or in the individual, do their own
2463 business? And justice is the quality which makes just men and just
2464 states. Moreover, our old division of labour, which required that there
2465 should be one man for one use, was a dream or anticipation of what was
2466 to follow; and that dream has now been realized in justice, which
2467 begins by binding together the three chords of the soul, and then acts
2468 harmoniously in every relation of life. And injustice, which is the
2469 insubordination and disobedience of the inferior elements in the soul,
2470 is the opposite of justice, and is inharmonious and unnatural, being to
2471 the soul what disease is to the body; for in the soul as well as in the
2472 body, good or bad actions produce good or bad habits. And virtue is the
2473 health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice is the disease
2474 and weakness and deformity of the soul.
2475 
2476 Again the old question returns upon us: Is justice or injustice the
2477 more profitable? The question has become ridiculous. For injustice, like
2478 mortal disease, makes life not worth having. Come up with me to the hill
2479 which overhangs the city and look down upon the single form of virtue,
2480 and the infinite forms of vice, among which are four special ones,
2481 characteristic both of states and of individuals. And the state which
2482 corresponds to the single form of virtue is that which we have been
2483 describing, wherein reason rules under one of two names--monarchy and
2484 aristocracy. Thus there are five forms in all, both of states and of
2485 souls...
2486 
2487 In attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties, Plato
2488 takes occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties. And
2489 the criterion which he proposes is difference in the working of the
2490 faculties. The same faculty cannot produce contradictory effects. But
2491 the path of early reasoners is beset by thorny entanglements, and he
2492 will not proceed a step without first clearing the ground. This leads
2493 him into a tiresome digression, which is intended to explain the nature
2494 of contradiction. First, the contradiction must be at the same time and
2495 in the same relation. Secondly, no extraneous word must be introduced
2496 into either of the terms in which the contradictory proposition is
2497 expressed: for example, thirst is of drink, not of warm drink. He
2498 implies, what he does not say, that if, by the advice of reason, or by
2499 the impulse of anger, a man is restrained from drinking, this proves
2500 that thirst, or desire under which thirst is included, is distinct
2501 from anger and reason. But suppose that we allow the term 'thirst' or
2502 'desire' to be modified, and say an 'angry thirst,' or a 'revengeful
2503 desire,' then the two spheres of desire and anger overlap and become
2504 confused. This case therefore has to be excluded. And still there
2505 remains an exception to the rule in the use of the term 'good,' which is
2506 always implied in the object of desire. These are the discussions of
2507 an age before logic; and any one who is wearied by them should remember
2508 that they are necessary to the clearing up of ideas in the first
2509 development of the human faculties.
2510 
2511 The psychology of Plato extends no further than the division of the soul
2512 into the rational, irascible, and concupiscent elements, which, as far
2513 as we know, was first made by him, and has been retained by Aristotle
2514 and succeeding ethical writers. The chief difficulty in this early
2515 analysis of the mind is to define exactly the place of the irascible
2516 faculty (Greek), which may be variously described under the terms
2517 righteous indignation, spirit, passion. It is the foundation of courage,
2518 which includes in Plato moral courage, the courage of enduring pain, and
2519 of surmounting intellectual difficulties, as well as of meeting dangers
2520 in war. Though irrational, it inclines to side with the rational: it
2521 cannot be aroused by punishment when justly inflicted: it sometimes
2522 takes the form of an enthusiasm which sustains a man in the performance
2523 of great actions. It is the 'lion heart' with which the reason makes
2524 a treaty. On the other hand it is negative rather than positive; it
2525 is indignant at wrong or falsehood, but does not, like Love in the
2526 Symposium and Phaedrus, aspire to the vision of Truth or Good. It is the
2527 peremptory military spirit which prevails in the government of honour.
2528 It differs from anger (Greek), this latter term having no accessory
2529 notion of righteous indignation. Although Aristotle has retained the
2530 word, yet we may observe that 'passion' (Greek) has with him lost its
2531 affinity to the rational and has become indistinguishable from 'anger'
2532 (Greek). And to this vernacular use Plato himself in the Laws seems to
2533 revert, though not always. By modern philosophy too, as well as in our
2534 ordinary conversation, the words anger or passion are employed almost
2535 exclusively in a bad sense; there is no connotation of a just or
2536 reasonable cause by which they are aroused. The feeling of 'righteous
2537 indignation' is too partial and accidental to admit of our regarding
2538 it as a separate virtue or habit. We are tempted also to doubt whether
2539 Plato is right in supposing that an offender, however justly condemned,
2540 could be expected to acknowledge the justice of his sentence; this is
2541 the spirit of a philosopher or martyr rather than of a criminal.
2542 
2543 We may observe how nearly Plato approaches Aristotle's famous thesis,
2544 that 'good actions produce good habits.' The words 'as healthy practices
2545 (Greek) produce health, so do just practices produce justice,' have
2546 a sound very like the Nicomachean Ethics. But we note also that an
2547 incidental remark in Plato has become a far-reaching principle in
2548 Aristotle, and an inseparable part of a great Ethical system.
2549 
2550 There is a difficulty in understanding what Plato meant by 'the longer
2551 way': he seems to intimate some metaphysic of the future which will not
2552 be satisfied with arguing from the principle of contradiction. In the
2553 sixth and seventh books (compare Sophist and Parmenides) he has given
2554 us a sketch of such a metaphysic; but when Glaucon asks for the final
2555 revelation of the idea of good, he is put off with the declaration
2556 that he has not yet studied the preliminary sciences. How he would have
2557 filled up the sketch, or argued about such questions from a higher point
2558 of view, we can only conjecture. Perhaps he hoped to find some a priori
2559 method of developing the parts out of the whole; or he might have asked
2560 which of the ideas contains the other ideas, and possibly have stumbled
2561 on the Hegelian identity of the 'ego' and the 'universal.' Or he may
2562 have imagined that ideas might be constructed in some manner analogous
2563 to the construction of figures and numbers in the mathematical sciences.
2564 The most certain and necessary truth was to Plato the universal; and to
2565 this he was always seeking to refer all knowledge or opinion, just as in
2566 modern times we seek to rest them on the opposite pole of induction and
2567 experience. The aspirations of metaphysicians have always tended to
2568 pass beyond the limits of human thought and language: they seem to have
2569 reached a height at which they are 'moving about in worlds unrealized,'
2570 and their conceptions, although profoundly affecting their own minds,
2571 become invisible or unintelligible to others. We are not therefore
2572 surprized to find that Plato himself has nowhere clearly explained his
2573 doctrine of ideas; or that his school in a later generation, like his
2574 contemporaries Glaucon and Adeimantus, were unable to follow him in
2575 this region of speculation. In the Sophist, where he is refuting the
2576 scepticism which maintained either that there was no such thing as
2577 predication, or that all might be predicated of all, he arrives at the
2578 conclusion that some ideas combine with some, but not all with all. But
2579 he makes only one or two steps forward on this path; he nowhere attains
2580 to any connected system of ideas, or even to a knowledge of the most
2581 elementary relations of the sciences to one another.
2582 
2583 BOOK V. I was going to enumerate the four forms of vice or decline in
2584 states, when Polemarchus--he was sitting a little farther from me
2585 than Adeimantus--taking him by the coat and leaning towards him, said
2586 something in an undertone, of which I only caught the words, 'Shall we
2587 let him off?' 'Certainly not,' said Adeimantus, raising his voice. Whom,
2588 I said, are you not going to let off? 'You,' he said. Why? 'Because
2589 we think that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting women and
2590 children, of whom you have slily disposed under the general formula
2591 that friends have all things in common.' And was I not right? 'Yes,'
2592 he replied, 'but there are many sorts of communism or community, and
2593 we want to know which of them is right. The company, as you have just
2594 heard, are resolved to have a further explanation.' Thrasymachus said,
2595 'Do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold, or to hear you
2596 discourse?' Yes, I said; but the discourse should be of a reasonable
2597 length. Glaucon added, 'Yes, Socrates, and there is reason in spending
2598 the whole of life in such discussions; but pray, without more ado, tell
2599 us how this community is to be carried out, and how the interval between
2600 birth and education is to be filled up.' Well, I said, the subject has
2601 several difficulties--What is possible? is the first question. What is
2602 desirable? is the second. 'Fear not,' he replied, 'for you are speaking
2603 among friends.' That, I replied, is a sorry consolation; I shall
2604 destroy my friends as well as myself. Not that I mind a little innocent
2605 laughter; but he who kills the truth is a murderer. 'Then,' said
2606 Glaucon, laughing, 'in case you should murder us we will acquit you
2607 beforehand, and you shall be held free from the guilt of deceiving us.'
2608 
2609 Socrates proceeds:--The guardians of our state are to be watch-dogs, as
2610 we have already said. Now dogs are not divided into hes and shes--we do
2611 not take the masculine gender out to hunt and leave the females at home
2612 to look after their puppies. They have the same employments--the only
2613 difference between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other
2614 weaker. But if women are to have the same employments as men, they must
2615 have the same education--they must be taught music and gymnastics, and
2616 the art of war. I know that a great joke will be made of their riding
2617 on horseback and carrying weapons; the sight of the naked old wrinkled
2618 women showing their agility in the palaestra will certainly not be a
2619 vision of beauty, and may be expected to become a famous jest. But we
2620 must not mind the wits; there was a time when they might have laughed at
2621 our present gymnastics. All is habit: people have at last found out that
2622 the exposure is better than the concealment of the person, and now they
2623 laugh no more. Evil only should be the subject of ridicule.
2624 
2625 The first question is, whether women are able either wholly or partially
2626 to share in the employments of men. And here we may be charged with
2627 inconsistency in making the proposal at all. For we started originally
2628 with the division of labour; and the diversity of employments was based
2629 on the difference of natures. But is there no difference between men
2630 and women? Nay, are they not wholly different? THERE was the difficulty,
2631 Glaucon, which made me unwilling to speak of family relations. However,
2632 when a man is out of his depth, whether in a pool or in an ocean, he can
2633 only swim for his life; and we must try to find a way of escape, if we
2634 can.
2635 
2636 The argument is, that different natures have different uses, and the
2637 natures of men and women are said to differ. But this is only a verbal
2638 opposition. We do not consider that the difference may be purely nominal
2639 and accidental; for example, a bald man and a hairy man are opposed in a
2640 single point of view, but you cannot infer that because a bald man is
2641 a cobbler a hairy man ought not to be a cobbler. Now why is such an
2642 inference erroneous? Simply because the opposition between them is
2643 partial only, like the difference between a male physician and a female
2644 physician, not running through the whole nature, like the difference
2645 between a physician and a carpenter. And if the difference of the sexes
2646 is only that the one beget and the other bear children, this does not
2647 prove that they ought to have distinct educations. Admitting that women
2648 differ from men in capacity, do not men equally differ from one another?
2649 Has not nature scattered all the qualities which our citizens require
2650 indifferently up and down among the two sexes? and even in their
2651 peculiar pursuits, are not women often, though in some cases superior to
2652 men, ridiculously enough surpassed by them? Women are the same in kind
2653 as men, and have the same aptitude or want of aptitude for medicine
2654 or gymnastic or war, but in a less degree. One woman will be a good
2655 guardian, another not; and the good must be chosen to be the colleagues
2656 of our guardians. If however their natures are the same, the inference
2657 is that their education must also be the same; there is no longer
2658 anything unnatural or impossible in a woman learning music and
2659 gymnastic. And the education which we give them will be the very best,
2660 far superior to that of cobblers, and will train up the very best women,
2661 and nothing can be more advantageous to the State than this. Therefore
2662 let them strip, clothed in their chastity, and share in the toils of war
2663 and in the defence of their country; he who laughs at them is a fool for
2664 his pains.
2665 
2666 The first wave is past, and the argument is compelled to admit that men
2667 and women have common duties and pursuits. A second and greater wave is
2668 rolling in--community of wives and children; is this either expedient
2669 or possible? The expediency I do not doubt; I am not so sure of the
2670 possibility. 'Nay, I think that a considerable doubt will be entertained
2671 on both points.' I meant to have escaped the trouble of proving the
2672 first, but as you have detected the little stratagem I must even submit.
2673 Only allow me to feed my fancy like the solitary in his walks, with a
2674 dream of what might be, and then I will return to the question of what
2675 can be.
2676 
2677 In the first place our rulers will enforce the laws and make new ones
2678 where they are wanted, and their allies or ministers will obey. You, as
2679 legislator, have already selected the men; and now you shall select
2680 the women. After the selection has been made, they will dwell in common
2681 houses and have their meals in common, and will be brought together by
2682 a necessity more certain than that of mathematics. But they cannot be
2683 allowed to live in licentiousness; that is an unholy thing, which
2684 the rulers are determined to prevent. For the avoidance of this, holy
2685 marriage festivals will be instituted, and their holiness will be in
2686 proportion to their usefulness. And here, Glaucon, I should like to ask
2687 (as I know that you are a breeder of birds and animals), Do you not take
2688 the greatest care in the mating? 'Certainly.' And there is no reason to
2689 suppose that less care is required in the marriage of human beings. But
2690 then our rulers must be skilful physicians of the State, for they will
2691 often need a strong dose of falsehood in order to bring about desirable
2692 unions between their subjects. The good must be paired with the good,
2693 and the bad with the bad, and the offspring of the one must be reared,
2694 and of the other destroyed; in this way the flock will be preserved in
2695 prime condition. Hymeneal festivals will be celebrated at times fixed
2696 with an eye to population, and the brides and bridegrooms will meet at
2697 them; and by an ingenious system of lots the rulers will contrive that
2698 the brave and the fair come together, and that those of inferior breed
2699 are paired with inferiors--the latter will ascribe to chance what is
2700 really the invention of the rulers. And when children are born, the
2701 offspring of the brave and fair will be carried to an enclosure in a
2702 certain part of the city, and there attended by suitable nurses; the
2703 rest will be hurried away to places unknown. The mothers will be brought
2704 to the fold and will suckle the children; care however must be taken
2705 that none of them recognise their own offspring; and if necessary other
2706 nurses may also be hired. The trouble of watching and getting up
2707 at night will be transferred to attendants. 'Then the wives of our
2708 guardians will have a fine easy time when they are having children.' And
2709 quite right too, I said, that they should.
2710 
2711 The parents ought to be in the prime of life, which for a man may be
2712 reckoned at thirty years--from twenty-five, when he has 'passed the
2713 point at which the speed of life is greatest,' to fifty-five; and at
2714 twenty years for a woman--from twenty to forty. Any one above or below
2715 those ages who partakes in the hymeneals shall be guilty of impiety;
2716 also every one who forms a marriage connexion at other times without the
2717 consent of the rulers. This latter regulation applies to those who are
2718 within the specified ages, after which they may range at will, provided
2719 they avoid the prohibited degrees of parents and children, or
2720 of brothers and sisters, which last, however, are not absolutely
2721 prohibited, if a dispensation be procured. 'But how shall we know the
2722 degrees of affinity, when all things are common?' The answer is, that
2723 brothers and sisters are all such as are born seven or nine months after
2724 the espousals, and their parents those who are then espoused, and every
2725 one will have many children and every child many parents.
2726 
2727 Socrates proceeds: I have now to prove that this scheme is advantageous
2728 and also consistent with our entire polity. The greatest good of a State
2729 is unity; the greatest evil, discord and distraction. And there will be
2730 unity where there are no private pleasures or pains or interests--where
2731 if one member suffers all the members suffer, if one citizen is touched
2732 all are quickly sensitive; and the least hurt to the little finger of
2733 the State runs through the whole body and vibrates to the soul. For the
2734 true State, like an individual, is injured as a whole when any part is
2735 affected. Every State has subjects and rulers, who in a democracy are
2736 called rulers, and in other States masters: but in our State they are
2737 called saviours and allies; and the subjects who in other States are
2738 termed slaves, are by us termed nurturers and paymasters, and those who
2739 are termed comrades and colleagues in other places, are by us called
2740 fathers and brothers. And whereas in other States members of the same
2741 government regard one of their colleagues as a friend and another as an
2742 enemy, in our State no man is a stranger to another; for every citizen
2743 is connected with every other by ties of blood, and these names and
2744 this way of speaking will have a corresponding reality--brother, father,
2745 sister, mother, repeated from infancy in the ears of children, will not
2746 be mere words. Then again the citizens will have all things in common,
2747 in having common property they will have common pleasures and pains.
2748 
2749 Can there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind; or
2750 lawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which
2751 they call their own; or suits about violence when every one is bound
2752 to defend himself? The permission to strike when insulted will be an
2753 'antidote' to the knife and will prevent disturbances in the State. But
2754 no younger man will strike an elder; reverence will prevent him from
2755 laying hands on his kindred, and he will fear that the rest of the
2756 family may retaliate. Moreover, our citizens will be rid of the
2757 lesser evils of life; there will be no flattery of the rich, no sordid
2758 household cares, no borrowing and not paying. Compared with the
2759 citizens of other States, ours will be Olympic victors, and crowned
2760 with blessings greater still--they and their children having a better
2761 maintenance during life, and after death an honourable burial. Nor has
2762 the happiness of the individual been sacrificed to the happiness of the
2763 State; our Olympic victor has not been turned into a cobbler, but he
2764 has a happiness beyond that of any cobbler. At the same time, if any
2765 conceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the State to himself,
2766 he must be reminded that 'half is better than the whole.' 'I should
2767 certainly advise him to stay where he is when he has the promise of such
2768 a brave life.'
2769 
2770 But is such a community possible?--as among the animals, so also among
2771 men; and if possible, in what way possible? About war there is no
2772 difficulty; the principle of communism is adapted to military service.
2773 Parents will take their children to look on at a battle, just as
2774 potters' boys are trained to the business by looking on at the wheel.
2775 And to the parents themselves, as to other animals, the sight of their
2776 young ones will prove a great incentive to bravery. Young warriors must
2777 learn, but they must not run into danger, although a certain degree of
2778 risk is worth incurring when the benefit is great. The young creatures
2779 should be placed under the care of experienced veterans, and they should
2780 have wings--that is to say, swift and tractable steeds on which they may
2781 fly away and escape. One of the first things to be done is to teach a
2782 youth to ride.
2783 
2784 Cowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen;
2785 gentlemen who allow themselves to be taken prisoners, may be presented
2786 to the enemy. But what shall be done to the hero? First of all he shall
2787 be crowned by all the youths in the army; secondly, he shall receive the
2788 right hand of fellowship; and thirdly, do you think that there is any
2789 harm in his being kissed? We have already determined that he shall have
2790 more wives than others, in order that he may have as many children
2791 as possible. And at a feast he shall have more to eat; we have the
2792 authority of Homer for honouring brave men with 'long chines,' which is
2793 an appropriate compliment, because meat is a very strengthening thing.
2794 Fill the bowl then, and give the best seats and meats to the brave--may
2795 they do them good! And he who dies in battle will be at once declared to
2796 be of the golden race, and will, as we believe, become one of Hesiod's
2797 guardian angels. He shall be worshipped after death in the manner
2798 prescribed by the oracle; and not only he, but all other benefactors
2799 of the State who die in any other way, shall be admitted to the same
2800 honours.
2801 
2802 The next question is, How shall we treat our enemies? Shall Hellenes be
2803 enslaved? No; for there is too great a risk of the whole race passing
2804 under the yoke of the barbarians. Or shall the dead be despoiled?
2805 Certainly not; for that sort of thing is an excuse for skulking, and has
2806 been the ruin of many an army. There is meanness and feminine malice in
2807 making an enemy of the dead body, when the soul which was the owner has
2808 fled--like a dog who cannot reach his assailants, and quarrels with
2809 the stones which are thrown at him instead. Again, the arms of Hellenes
2810 should not be offered up in the temples of the Gods; they are a
2811 pollution, for they are taken from brethren. And on similar grounds
2812 there should be a limit to the devastation of Hellenic territory--the
2813 houses should not be burnt, nor more than the annual produce carried
2814 off. For war is of two kinds, civil and foreign; the first of which is
2815 properly termed 'discord,' and only the second 'war;' and war between
2816 Hellenes is in reality civil war--a quarrel in a family, which is ever
2817 to be regarded as unpatriotic and unnatural, and ought to be prosecuted
2818 with a view to reconciliation in a true phil-Hellenic spirit, as of
2819 those who would chasten but not utterly enslave. The war is not against
2820 a whole nation who are a friendly multitude of men, women, and children,
2821 but only against a few guilty persons; when they are punished peace will
2822 be restored. That is the way in which Hellenes should war against one
2823 another--and against barbarians, as they war against one another now.
2824 
2825 'But, my dear Socrates, you are forgetting the main question: Is such a
2826 State possible? I grant all and more than you say about the blessedness
2827 of being one family--fathers, brothers, mothers, daughters, going out
2828 to war together; but I want to ascertain the possibility of this ideal
2829 State.' You are too unmerciful. The first wave and the second wave I
2830 have hardly escaped, and now you will certainly drown me with the third.
2831 When you see the towering crest of the wave, I expect you to take pity.
2832 'Not a whit.'
2833 
2834 Well, then, we were led to form our ideal polity in the search after
2835 justice, and the just man answered to the just State. Is this ideal at
2836 all the worse for being impracticable? Would the picture of a perfectly
2837 beautiful man be any the worse because no such man ever lived? Can any
2838 reality come up to the idea? Nature will not allow words to be fully
2839 realized; but if I am to try and realize the ideal of the State in a
2840 measure, I think that an approach may be made to the perfection of which
2841 I dream by one or two, I do not say slight, but possible changes in the
2842 present constitution of States. I would reduce them to a single one--the
2843 great wave, as I call it. Until, then, kings are philosophers, or
2844 philosophers are kings, cities will never cease from ill: no, nor the
2845 human race; nor will our ideal polity ever come into being. I know that
2846 this is a hard saying, which few will be able to receive. 'Socrates,
2847 all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with sticks and
2848 stones, and therefore I would advise you to prepare an answer.' You got
2849 me into the scrape, I said. 'And I was right,' he replied; 'however, I
2850 will stand by you as a sort of do-nothing, well-meaning ally.' Having
2851 the help of such a champion, I will do my best to maintain my position.
2852 And first, I must explain of whom I speak and what sort of natures these
2853 are who are to be philosophers and rulers. As you are a man of pleasure,
2854 you will not have forgotten how indiscriminate lovers are in their
2855 attachments; they love all, and turn blemishes into beauties. The
2856 snub-nosed youth is said to have a winning grace; the beak of another
2857 has a royal look; the featureless are faultless; the dark are manly, the
2858 fair angels; the sickly have a new term of endearment invented expressly
2859 for them, which is 'honey-pale.' Lovers of wine and lovers of ambition
2860 also desire the objects of their affection in every form. Now here comes
2861 the point:--The philosopher too is a lover of knowledge in every form;
2862 he has an insatiable curiosity. 'But will curiosity make a philosopher?
2863 Are the lovers of sights and sounds, who let out their ears to every
2864 chorus at the Dionysiac festivals, to be called philosophers?' They
2865 are not true philosophers, but only an imitation. 'Then how are we to
2866 describe the true?'
2867 
2868 You would acknowledge the existence of abstract ideas, such as justice,
2869 beauty, good, evil, which are severally one, yet in their various
2870 combinations appear to be many. Those who recognize these realities are
2871 philosophers; whereas the other class hear sounds and see colours,
2872 and understand their use in the arts, but cannot attain to the true or
2873 waking vision of absolute justice or beauty or truth; they have not the
2874 light of knowledge, but of opinion, and what they see is a dream only.
2875 Perhaps he of whom we say the last will be angry with us; can we pacify
2876 him without revealing the disorder of his mind? Suppose we say that,
2877 if he has knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of
2878 something which is, as ignorance is of something which is not; and there
2879 is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of opinion
2880 only. Opinion and knowledge, then, having distinct objects, must also
2881 be distinct faculties. And by faculties I mean powers unseen and
2882 distinguishable only by the difference in their objects, as opinion
2883 and knowledge differ, since the one is liable to err, but the other
2884 is unerring and is the mightiest of all our faculties. If being is
2885 the object of knowledge, and not-being of ignorance, and these are the
2886 extremes, opinion must lie between them, and may be called darker than
2887 the one and brighter than the other. This intermediate or contingent
2888 matter is and is not at the same time, and partakes both of existence
2889 and of non-existence. Now I would ask my good friend, who denies
2890 abstract beauty and justice, and affirms a many beautiful and a
2891 many just, whether everything he sees is not in some point of view
2892 different--the beautiful ugly, the pious impious, the just unjust? Is
2893 not the double also the half, and are not heavy and light relative terms
2894 which pass into one another? Everything is and is not, as in the old
2895 riddle--'A man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a
2896 bird with a stone and not a stone.' The mind cannot be fixed on either
2897 alternative; and these ambiguous, intermediate, erring, half-lighted
2898 objects, which have a disorderly movement in the region between being
2899 and not-being, are the proper matter of opinion, as the immutable
2900 objects are the proper matter of knowledge. And he who grovels in the
2901 world of sense, and has only this uncertain perception of things, is not
2902 a philosopher, but a lover of opinion only...
2903 
2904 The fifth book is the new beginning of the Republic, in which the
2905 community of property and of family are first maintained, and the
2906 transition is made to the kingdom of philosophers. For both of these
2907 Plato, after his manner, has been preparing in some chance words of Book
2908 IV, which fall unperceived on the reader's mind, as they are supposed
2909 at first to have fallen on the ear of Glaucon and Adeimantus. The
2910 'paradoxes,' as Morgenstern terms them, of this book of the Republic
2911 will be reserved for another place; a few remarks on the style, and some
2912 explanations of difficulties, may be briefly added.
2913 
2914 First, there is the image of the waves, which serves for a sort of
2915 scheme or plan of the book. The first wave, the second wave, the third
2916 and greatest wave come rolling in, and we hear the roar of them. All
2917 that can be said of the extravagance of Plato's proposals is anticipated
2918 by himself. Nothing is more admirable than the hesitation with which he
2919 proposes the solemn text, 'Until kings are philosophers,' etc.; or the
2920 reaction from the sublime to the ridiculous, when Glaucon describes the
2921 manner in which the new truth will be received by mankind.
2922 
2923 Some defects and difficulties may be noted in the execution of the
2924 communistic plan. Nothing is told us of the application of communism
2925 to the lower classes; nor is the table of prohibited degrees capable of
2926 being made out. It is quite possible that a child born at one hymeneal
2927 festival may marry one of its own brothers or sisters, or even one of
2928 its parents, at another. Plato is afraid of incestuous unions, but at
2929 the same time he does not wish to bring before us the fact that the city
2930 would be divided into families of those born seven and nine months after
2931 each hymeneal festival. If it were worth while to argue seriously about
2932 such fancies, we might remark that while all the old affinities are
2933 abolished, the newly prohibited affinity rests not on any natural or
2934 rational principle, but only upon the accident of children having been
2935 born in the same month and year. Nor does he explain how the lots could
2936 be so manipulated by the legislature as to bring together the fairest
2937 and best. The singular expression which is employed to describe the age
2938 of five-and-twenty may perhaps be taken from some poet.
2939 
2940 In the delineation of the philosopher, the illustrations of the nature
2941 of philosophy derived from love are more suited to the apprehension
2942 of Glaucon, the Athenian man of pleasure, than to modern tastes or
2943 feelings. They are partly facetious, but also contain a germ of truth.
2944 That science is a whole, remains a true principle of inductive as well
2945 as of metaphysical philosophy; and the love of universal knowledge is
2946 still the characteristic of the philosopher in modern as well as in
2947 ancient times.
2948 
2949 At the end of the fifth book Plato introduces the figment of contingent
2950 matter, which has exercised so great an influence both on the Ethics and
2951 Theology of the modern world, and which occurs here for the first time
2952 in the history of philosophy. He did not remark that the degrees of
2953 knowledge in the subject have nothing corresponding to them in the
2954 object. With him a word must answer to an idea; and he could not
2955 conceive of an opinion which was an opinion about nothing. The influence
2956 of analogy led him to invent 'parallels and conjugates' and to overlook
2957 facts. To us some of his difficulties are puzzling only from their
2958 simplicity: we do not perceive that the answer to them 'is tumbling out
2959 at our feet.' To the mind of early thinkers, the conception of not-being
2960 was dark and mysterious; they did not see that this terrible apparition
2961 which threatened destruction to all knowledge was only a logical
2962 determination. The common term under which, through the accidental use
2963 of language, two entirely different ideas were included was another
2964 source of confusion. Thus through the ambiguity of (Greek) Plato,
2965 attempting to introduce order into the first chaos of human thought,
2966 seems to have confused perception and opinion, and to have failed to
2967 distinguish the contingent from the relative. In the Theaetetus the
2968 first of these difficulties begins to clear up; in the Sophist the
2969 second; and for this, as well as for other reasons, both these dialogues
2970 are probably to be regarded as later than the Republic.
2971 
2972 BOOK VI. Having determined that the many have no knowledge of true
2973 being, and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice, beauty,
2974 truth, and that philosophers have such patterns, we have now to ask
2975 whether they or the many shall be rulers in our State. But who can doubt
2976 that philosophers should be chosen, if they have the other qualities
2977 which are required in a ruler? For they are lovers of the knowledge of
2978 the eternal and of all truth; they are haters of falsehood; their meaner
2979 desires are absorbed in the interests of knowledge; they are spectators
2980 of all time and all existence; and in the magnificence of their
2981 contemplation the life of man is as nothing to them, nor is death
2982 fearful. Also they are of a social, gracious disposition, equally free
2983 from cowardice and arrogance. They learn and remember easily; they have
2984 harmonious, well-regulated minds; truth flows to them sweetly by nature.
2985 Can the god of Jealousy himself find any fault with such an assemblage
2986 of good qualities?
2987 
2988 Here Adeimantus interposes:--'No man can answer you, Socrates; but every
2989 man feels that this is owing to his own deficiency in argument. He is
2990 driven from one position to another, until he has nothing more to say,
2991 just as an unskilful player at draughts is reduced to his last move by
2992 a more skilled opponent. And yet all the time he may be right. He may
2993 know, in this very instance, that those who make philosophy the business
2994 of their lives, generally turn out rogues if they are bad men, and fools
2995 if they are good. What do you say?' I should say that he is quite right.
2996 'Then how is such an admission reconcileable with the doctrine that
2997 philosophers should be kings?'
2998 
2999 I shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a
3000 hand I am at the invention of allegories. The relation of good men to
3001 their governments is so peculiar, that in order to defend them I must
3002 take an illustration from the world of fiction. Conceive the captain
3003 of a ship, taller by a head and shoulders than any of the crew, yet a
3004 little deaf, a little blind, and rather ignorant of the seaman's art.
3005 The sailors want to steer, although they know nothing of the art; and
3006 they have a theory that it cannot be learned. If the helm is refused
3007 them, they drug the captain's posset, bind him hand and foot, and take
3008 possession of the ship. He who joins in the mutiny is termed a good
3009 pilot and what not; they have no conception that the true pilot must
3010 observe the winds and the stars, and must be their master, whether
3011 they like it or not;--such an one would be called by them fool, prater,
3012 star-gazer. This is my parable; which I will beg you to interpret for
3013 me to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil name,
3014 and to explain to them that not he, but those who will not use him, are
3015 to blame for his uselessness. The philosopher should not beg of mankind
3016 to be put in authority over them. The wise man should not seek the rich,
3017 as the proverb bids, but every man, whether rich or poor, must knock at
3018 the door of the physician when he has need of him. Now the pilot is
3019 the philosopher--he whom in the parable they call star-gazer, and the
3020 mutinous sailors are the mob of politicians by whom he is rendered
3021 useless. Not that these are the worst enemies of philosophy, who is far
3022 more dishonoured by her own professing sons when they are corrupted by
3023 the world. Need I recall the original image of the philosopher? Did we
3024 not say of him just now, that he loved truth and hated falsehood, and
3025 that he could not rest in the multiplicity of phenomena, but was led by
3026 a sympathy in his own nature to the contemplation of the absolute? All
3027 the virtues as well as truth, who is the leader of them, took up their
3028 abode in his soul. But as you were observing, if we turn aside to view
3029 the reality, we see that the persons who were thus described, with the
3030 exception of a small and useless class, are utter rogues.
3031 
3032 The point which has to be considered, is the origin of this corruption
3033 in nature. Every one will admit that the philosopher, in our description
3034 of him, is a rare being. But what numberless causes tend to destroy
3035 these rare beings! There is no good thing which may not be a cause of
3036 evil--health, wealth, strength, rank, and the virtues themselves,
3037 when placed under unfavourable circumstances. For as in the animal or
3038 vegetable world the strongest seeds most need the accompaniment of good
3039 air and soil, so the best of human characters turn out the worst when
3040 they fall upon an unsuitable soil; whereas weak natures hardly ever
3041 do any considerable good or harm; they are not the stuff out of which
3042 either great criminals or great heroes are made. The philosopher follows
3043 the same analogy: he is either the best or the worst of all men. Some
3044 persons say that the Sophists are the corrupters of youth; but is not
3045 public opinion the real Sophist who is everywhere present--in those very
3046 persons, in the assembly, in the courts, in the camp, in the applauses
3047 and hisses of the theatre re-echoed by the surrounding hills? Will not
3048 a young man's heart leap amid these discordant sounds? and will any
3049 education save him from being carried away by the torrent? Nor is this
3050 all. For if he will not yield to opinion, there follows the gentle
3051 compulsion of exile or death. What principle of rival Sophists or
3052 anybody else can overcome in such an unequal contest? Characters there
3053 may be more than human, who are exceptions--God may save a man, but not
3054 his own strength. Further, I would have you consider that the hireling
3055 Sophist only gives back to the world their own opinions; he is the
3056 keeper of the monster, who knows how to flatter or anger him, and
3057 observes the meaning of his inarticulate grunts. Good is what pleases
3058 him, evil what he dislikes; truth and beauty are determined only by
3059 the taste of the brute. Such is the Sophist's wisdom, and such is the
3060 condition of those who make public opinion the test of truth, whether in
3061 art or in morals. The curse is laid upon them of being and doing what
3062 it approves, and when they attempt first principles the failure is
3063 ludicrous. Think of all this and ask yourself whether the world is more
3064 likely to be a believer in the unity of the idea, or in the multiplicity
3065 of phenomena. And the world if not a believer in the idea cannot be a
3066 philosopher, and must therefore be a persecutor of philosophers. There
3067 is another evil:--the world does not like to lose the gifted nature, and
3068 so they flatter the young (Alcibiades) into a magnificent opinion of his
3069 own capacity; the tall, proper youth begins to expand, and is dreaming
3070 of kingdoms and empires. If at this instant a friend whispers to
3071 him, 'Now the gods lighten thee; thou art a great fool' and must be
3072 educated--do you think that he will listen? Or suppose a better sort of
3073 man who is attracted towards philosophy, will they not make Herculean
3074 efforts to spoil and corrupt him? Are we not right in saying that the
3075 love of knowledge, no less than riches, may divert him? Men of this
3076 class (Critias) often become politicians--they are the authors of
3077 great mischief in states, and sometimes also of great good. And thus
3078 philosophy is deserted by her natural protectors, and others enter in
3079 and dishonour her. Vulgar little minds see the land open and rush from
3080 the prisons of the arts into her temple. A clever mechanic having a
3081 soul coarse as his body, thinks that he will gain caste by becoming her
3082 suitor. For philosophy, even in her fallen estate, has a dignity of her
3083 own--and he, like a bald little blacksmith's apprentice as he is, having
3084 made some money and got out of durance, washes and dresses himself as a
3085 bridegroom and marries his master's daughter. What will be the issue of
3086 such marriages? Will they not be vile and bastard, devoid of truth
3087 and nature? 'They will.' Small, then, is the remnant of genuine
3088 philosophers; there may be a few who are citizens of small states, in
3089 which politics are not worth thinking of, or who have been detained by
3090 Theages' bridle of ill health; for my own case of the oracular sign is
3091 almost unique, and too rare to be worth mentioning. And these few when
3092 they have tasted the pleasures of philosophy, and have taken a look at
3093 that den of thieves and place of wild beasts, which is human life,
3094 will stand aside from the storm under the shelter of a wall, and try to
3095 preserve their own innocence and to depart in peace. 'A great work, too,
3096 will have been accomplished by them.' Great, yes, but not the greatest;
3097 for man is a social being, and can only attain his highest development
3098 in the society which is best suited to him.
3099 
3100 Enough, then, of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name.
3101 Another question is, Which of existing states is suited to her? Not one
3102 of them; at present she is like some exotic seed which degenerates in
3103 a strange soil; only in her proper state will she be shown to be of
3104 heavenly growth. 'And is her proper state ours or some other?' Ours in
3105 all points but one, which was left undetermined. You may remember our
3106 saying that some living mind or witness of the legislator was needed in
3107 states. But we were afraid to enter upon a subject of such difficulty,
3108 and now the question recurs and has not grown easier:--How may
3109 philosophy be safely studied? Let us bring her into the light of day,
3110 and make an end of the inquiry.
3111 
3112 In the first place, I say boldly that nothing can be worse than the
3113 present mode of study. Persons usually pick up a little philosophy in
3114 early youth, and in the intervals of business, but they never master the
3115 real difficulty, which is dialectic. Later, perhaps, they occasionally
3116 go to a lecture on philosophy. Years advance, and the sun of philosophy,
3117 unlike that of Heracleitus, sets never to rise again. This order of
3118 education should be reversed; it should begin with gymnastics in youth,
3119 and as the man strengthens, he should increase the gymnastics of
3120 his soul. Then, when active life is over, let him finally return to
3121 philosophy. 'You are in earnest, Socrates, but the world will be equally
3122 earnest in withstanding you--no more than Thrasymachus.' Do not make a
3123 quarrel between Thrasymachus and me, who were never enemies and are
3124 now good friends enough. And I shall do my best to convince him and
3125 all mankind of the truth of my words, or at any rate to prepare for
3126 the future when, in another life, we may again take part in similar
3127 discussions. 'That will be a long time hence.' Not long in comparison
3128 with eternity. The many will probably remain incredulous, for they
3129 have never seen the natural unity of ideas, but only artificial
3130 juxtapositions; not free and generous thoughts, but tricks of
3131 controversy and quips of law;--a perfect man ruling in a perfect state,
3132 even a single one they have not known. And we foresaw that there was no
3133 chance of perfection either in states or individuals until a necessity
3134 was laid upon philosophers--not the rogues, but those whom we called
3135 the useless class--of holding office; or until the sons of kings were
3136 inspired with a true love of philosophy. Whether in the infinity of
3137 past time there has been, or is in some distant land, or ever will be
3138 hereafter, an ideal such as we have described, we stoutly maintain
3139 that there has been, is, and will be such a state whenever the Muse of
3140 philosophy rules. Will you say that the world is of another mind? O, my
3141 friend, do not revile the world! They will soon change their opinion
3142 if they are gently entreated, and are taught the true nature of the
3143 philosopher. Who can hate a man who loves him? Or be jealous of one who
3144 has no jealousy? Consider, again, that the many hate not the true but
3145 the false philosophers--the pretenders who force their way in without
3146 invitation, and are always speaking of persons and not of principles,
3147 which is unlike the spirit of philosophy. For the true philosopher
3148 despises earthly strife; his eye is fixed on the eternal order in
3149 accordance with which he moulds himself into the Divine image (and not
3150 himself only, but other men), and is the creator of the virtues private
3151 as well as public. When mankind see that the happiness of states is only
3152 to be found in that image, will they be angry with us for attempting
3153 to delineate it? 'Certainly not. But what will be the process of
3154 delineation?' The artist will do nothing until he has made a tabula
3155 rasa; on this he will inscribe the constitution of a state, glancing
3156 often at the divine truth of nature, and from that deriving the godlike
3157 among men, mingling the two elements, rubbing out and painting in,
3158 until there is a perfect harmony or fusion of the divine and human. But
3159 perhaps the world will doubt the existence of such an artist. What will
3160 they doubt? That the philosopher is a lover of truth, having a nature
3161 akin to the best?--and if they admit this will they still quarrel with
3162 us for making philosophers our kings? 'They will be less disposed to
3163 quarrel.' Let us assume then that they are pacified. Still, a person may
3164 hesitate about the probability of the son of a king being a philosopher.
3165 And we do not deny that they are very liable to be corrupted; but yet
3166 surely in the course of ages there might be one exception--and one
3167 is enough. If one son of a king were a philosopher, and had obedient
3168 citizens, he might bring the ideal polity into being. Hence we conclude
3169 that our laws are not only the best, but that they are also possible,
3170 though not free from difficulty.
3171 
3172 I gained nothing by evading the troublesome questions which arose
3173 concerning women and children. I will be wiser now and acknowledge
3174 that we must go to the bottom of another question: What is to be the
3175 education of our guardians? It was agreed that they were to be lovers of
3176 their country, and were to be tested in the refiner's fire of pleasures
3177 and pains, and those who came forth pure and remained fixed in their
3178 principles were to have honours and rewards in life and after death.
3179 But at this point, the argument put on her veil and turned into another
3180 path. I hesitated to make the assertion which I now hazard,--that our
3181 guardians must be philosophers. You remember all the contradictory
3182 elements, which met in the philosopher--how difficult to find them all
3183 in a single person! Intelligence and spirit are not often combined with
3184 steadiness; the stolid, fearless, nature is averse to intellectual toil.
3185 And yet these opposite elements are all necessary, and therefore, as
3186 we were saying before, the aspirant must be tested in pleasures and
3187 dangers; and also, as we must now further add, in the highest branches
3188 of knowledge. You will remember, that when we spoke of the virtues
3189 mention was made of a longer road, which you were satisfied to leave
3190 unexplored. 'Enough seemed to have been said.' Enough, my friend; but
3191 what is enough while anything remains wanting? Of all men the guardian
3192 must not faint in the search after truth; he must be prepared to take
3193 the longer road, or he will never reach that higher region which is
3194 above the four virtues; and of the virtues too he must not only get an
3195 outline, but a clear and distinct vision. (Strange that we should be so
3196 precise about trifles, so careless about the highest truths!) 'And what
3197 are the highest?' You to pretend unconsciousness, when you have so often
3198 heard me speak of the idea of good, about which we know so little, and
3199 without which though a man gain the world he has no profit of it! Some
3200 people imagine that the good is wisdom; but this involves a circle,--the
3201 good, they say, is wisdom, wisdom has to do with the good. According to
3202 others the good is pleasure; but then comes the absurdity that good is
3203 bad, for there are bad pleasures as well as good. Again, the good must
3204 have reality; a man may desire the appearance of virtue, but he will not
3205 desire the appearance of good. Ought our guardians then to be ignorant
3206 of this supreme principle, of which every man has a presentiment, and
3207 without which no man has any real knowledge of anything? 'But, Socrates,
3208 what is this supreme principle, knowledge or pleasure, or what? You may
3209 think me troublesome, but I say that you have no business to be always
3210 repeating the doctrines of others instead of giving us your own.' Can
3211 I say what I do not know? 'You may offer an opinion.' And will the
3212 blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have
3213 the light and certainty of science? 'I will only ask you to give such
3214 an explanation of the good as you have given already of temperance and
3215 justice.' I wish that I could, but in my present mood I cannot reach to
3216 the height of the knowledge of the good. To the parent or principal I
3217 cannot introduce you, but to the child begotten in his image, which
3218 I may compare with the interest on the principal, I will. (Audit the
3219 account, and do not let me give you a false statement of the debt.)
3220 You remember our old distinction of the many beautiful and the one
3221 beautiful, the particular and the universal, the objects of sight and
3222 the objects of thought? Did you ever consider that the objects of sight
3223 imply a faculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our
3224 senses, requiring not only objects of sense, but also a medium, which is
3225 light; without which the sight will not distinguish between colours and
3226 all will be a blank? For light is the noble bond between the perceiving
3227 faculty and the thing perceived, and the god who gives us light is the
3228 sun, who is the eye of the day, but is not to be confounded with the eye
3229 of man. This eye of the day or sun is what I call the child of the good,
3230 standing in the same relation to the visible world as the good to the
3231 intellectual. When the sun shines the eye sees, and in the intellectual
3232 world where truth is, there is sight and light. Now that which is the
3233 sun of intelligent natures, is the idea of good, the cause of knowledge
3234 and truth, yet other and fairer than they are, and standing in the
3235 same relation to them in which the sun stands to light. O inconceivable
3236 height of beauty, which is above knowledge and above truth! ('You cannot
3237 surely mean pleasure,' he said. Peace, I replied.) And this idea of
3238 good, like the sun, is also the cause of growth, and the author not of
3239 knowledge only, but of being, yet greater far than either in dignity
3240 and power. 'That is a reach of thought more than human; but, pray, go
3241 on with the image, for I suspect that there is more behind.' There is,
3242 I said; and bearing in mind our two suns or principles, imagine further
3243 their corresponding worlds--one of the visible, the other of the
3244 intelligible; you may assist your fancy by figuring the distinction
3245 under the image of a line divided into two unequal parts, and may again
3246 subdivide each part into two lesser segments representative of the
3247 stages of knowledge in either sphere. The lower portion of the lower or
3248 visible sphere will consist of shadows and reflections, and its upper
3249 and smaller portion will contain real objects in the world of nature
3250 or of art. The sphere of the intelligible will also have two
3251 divisions,--one of mathematics, in which there is no ascent but all is
3252 descent; no inquiring into premises, but only drawing of inferences.
3253 In this division the mind works with figures and numbers, the images of
3254 which are taken not from the shadows, but from the objects, although
3255 the truth of them is seen only with the mind's eye; and they are used as
3256 hypotheses without being analysed. Whereas in the other division reason
3257 uses the hypotheses as stages or steps in the ascent to the idea of
3258 good, to which she fastens them, and then again descends, walking firmly
3259 in the region of ideas, and of ideas only, in her ascent as well as
3260 descent, and finally resting in them. 'I partly understand,' he replied;
3261 'you mean that the ideas of science are superior to the hypothetical,
3262 metaphorical conceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences,
3263 whichever is to be the name of them; and the latter conceptions you
3264 refuse to make subjects of pure intellect, because they have no first
3265 principle, although when resting on a first principle, they pass into
3266 the higher sphere.' You understand me very well, I said. And now to
3267 those four divisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding
3268 faculties--pure intelligence to the highest sphere; active intelligence
3269 to the second; to the third, faith; to the fourth, the perception of
3270 shadows--and the clearness of the several faculties will be in the same
3271 ratio as the truth of the objects to which they are related...
3272 
3273 Like Socrates, we may recapitulate the virtues of the philosopher.
3274 In language which seems to reach beyond the horizon of that age
3275 and country, he is described as 'the spectator of all time and all
3276 existence.' He has the noblest gifts of nature, and makes the highest
3277 use of them. All his desires are absorbed in the love of wisdom, which
3278 is the love of truth. None of the graces of a beautiful soul are wanting
3279 in him; neither can he fear death, or think much of human life. The
3280 ideal of modern times hardly retains the simplicity of the antique;
3281 there is not the same originality either in truth or error which
3282 characterized the Greeks. The philosopher is no longer living in the
3283 unseen, nor is he sent by an oracle to convince mankind of ignorance;
3284 nor does he regard knowledge as a system of ideas leading upwards by
3285 regular stages to the idea of good. The eagerness of the pursuit has
3286 abated; there is more division of labour and less of comprehensive
3287 reflection upon nature and human life as a whole; more of exact
3288 observation and less of anticipation and inspiration. Still, in the
3289 altered conditions of knowledge, the parallel is not wholly lost; and
3290 there may be a use in translating the conception of Plato into the
3291 language of our own age. The philosopher in modern times is one who
3292 fixes his mind on the laws of nature in their sequence and connexion,
3293 not on fragments or pictures of nature; on history, not on controversy;
3294 on the truths which are acknowledged by the few, not on the opinions
3295 of the many. He is aware of the importance of 'classifying according to
3296 nature,' and will try to 'separate the limbs of science without breaking
3297 them' (Phaedr.). There is no part of truth, whether great or small,
3298 which he will dishonour; and in the least things he will discern the
3299 greatest (Parmen.). Like the ancient philosopher he sees the world
3300 pervaded by analogies, but he can also tell 'why in some cases a single
3301 instance is sufficient for an induction' (Mill's Logic), while in
3302 other cases a thousand examples would prove nothing. He inquires into
3303 a portion of knowledge only, because the whole has grown too vast to be
3304 embraced by a single mind or life. He has a clearer conception of the
3305 divisions of science and of their relation to the mind of man than was
3306 possible to the ancients. Like Plato, he has a vision of the unity of
3307 knowledge, not as the beginning of philosophy to be attained by a study
3308 of elementary mathematics, but as the far-off result of the working
3309 of many minds in many ages. He is aware that mathematical studies are
3310 preliminary to almost every other; at the same time, he will not reduce
3311 all varieties of knowledge to the type of mathematics. He too must have
3312 a nobility of character, without which genius loses the better half
3313 of greatness. Regarding the world as a point in immensity, and each
3314 individual as a link in a never-ending chain of existence, he will not
3315 think much of his own life, or be greatly afraid of death.
3316 
3317 Adeimantus objects first of all to the form of the Socratic reasoning,
3318 thus showing that Plato is aware of the imperfection of his own method.
3319 He brings the accusation against himself which might be brought against
3320 him by a modern logician--that he extracts the answer because he knows
3321 how to put the question. In a long argument words are apt to change
3322 their meaning slightly, or premises may be assumed or conclusions
3323 inferred with rather too much certainty or universality; the variation
3324 at each step may be unobserved, and yet at last the divergence becomes
3325 considerable. Hence the failure of attempts to apply arithmetical or
3326 algebraic formulae to logic. The imperfection, or rather the higher
3327 and more elastic nature of language, does not allow words to have the
3328 precision of numbers or of symbols. And this quality in language impairs
3329 the force of an argument which has many steps.
3330 
3331 The objection, though fairly met by Socrates in this particular
3332 instance, may be regarded as implying a reflection upon the Socratic
3333 mode of reasoning. And here, as elsewhere, Plato seems to intimate that
3334 the time had come when the negative and interrogative method of Socrates
3335 must be superseded by a positive and constructive one, of which examples
3336 are given in some of the later dialogues. Adeimantus further argues
3337 that the ideal is wholly at variance with facts; for experience proves
3338 philosophers to be either useless or rogues. Contrary to all expectation
3339 Socrates has no hesitation in admitting the truth of this, and explains
3340 the anomaly in an allegory, first characteristically depreciating his
3341 own inventive powers. In this allegory the people are distinguished from
3342 the professional politicians, and, as elsewhere, are spoken of in a tone
3343 of pity rather than of censure under the image of 'the noble captain who
3344 is not very quick in his perceptions.'
3345 
3346 The uselessness of philosophers is explained by the circumstance that
3347 mankind will not use them. The world in all ages has been divided
3348 between contempt and fear of those who employ the power of ideas and
3349 know no other weapons. Concerning the false philosopher, Socrates argues
3350 that the best is most liable to corruption; and that the finer nature is
3351 more likely to suffer from alien conditions. We too observe that there
3352 are some kinds of excellence which spring from a peculiar delicacy
3353 of constitution; as is evidently true of the poetical and imaginative
3354 temperament, which often seems to depend on impressions, and hence can
3355 only breathe or live in a certain atmosphere. The man of genius
3356 has greater pains and greater pleasures, greater powers and greater
3357 weaknesses, and often a greater play of character than is to be found in
3358 ordinary men. He can assume the disguise of virtue or disinterestedness
3359 without having them, or veil personal enmity in the language of
3360 patriotism and philosophy,--he can say the word which all men are
3361 thinking, he has an insight which is terrible into the follies and
3362 weaknesses of his fellow-men. An Alcibiades, a Mirabeau, or a Napoleon
3363 the First, are born either to be the authors of great evils in states,
3364 or 'of great good, when they are drawn in that direction.'
3365 
3366 Yet the thesis, 'corruptio optimi pessima,' cannot be maintained
3367 generally or without regard to the kind of excellence which is
3368 corrupted. The alien conditions which are corrupting to one nature, may
3369 be the elements of culture to another. In general a man can only receive
3370 his highest development in a congenial state or family, among friends
3371 or fellow-workers. But also he may sometimes be stirred by adverse
3372 circumstances to such a degree that he rises up against them and reforms
3373 them. And while weaker or coarser characters will extract good out of
3374 evil, say in a corrupt state of the church or of society, and live on
3375 happily, allowing the evil to remain, the finer or stronger natures may
3376 be crushed or spoiled by surrounding influences--may become misanthrope
3377 and philanthrope by turns; or in a few instances, like the founders
3378 of the monastic orders, or the Reformers, owing to some peculiarity in
3379 themselves or in their age, may break away entirely from the world and
3380 from the church, sometimes into great good, sometimes into great evil,
3381 sometimes into both. And the same holds in the lesser sphere of a
3382 convent, a school, a family.
3383 
3384 Plato would have us consider how easily the best natures are overpowered
3385 by public opinion, and what efforts the rest of mankind will make to
3386 get possession of them. The world, the church, their own profession, any
3387 political or party organization, are always carrying them off their legs
3388 and teaching them to apply high and holy names to their own prejudices
3389 and interests. The 'monster' corporation to which they belong judges
3390 right and truth to be the pleasure of the community. The individual
3391 becomes one with his order; or, if he resists, the world is too much for
3392 him, and will sooner or later be revenged on him. This is, perhaps, a
3393 one-sided but not wholly untrue picture of the maxims and practice of
3394 mankind when they 'sit down together at an assembly,' either in ancient
3395 or modern times.
3396 
3397 When the higher natures are corrupted by politics, the lower take
3398 possession of the vacant place of philosophy. This is described in one
3399 of those continuous images in which the argument, to use a Platonic
3400 expression, 'veils herself,' and which is dropped and reappears at
3401 intervals. The question is asked,--Why are the citizens of states so
3402 hostile to philosophy? The answer is, that they do not know her. And yet
3403 there is also a better mind of the many; they would believe if they were
3404 taught. But hitherto they have only known a conventional imitation of
3405 philosophy, words without thoughts, systems which have no life in them;
3406 a (divine) person uttering the words of beauty and freedom, the friend
3407 of man holding communion with the Eternal, and seeking to frame the
3408 state in that image, they have never known. The same double feeling
3409 respecting the mass of mankind has always existed among men. The first
3410 thought is that the people are the enemies of truth and right; the
3411 second, that this only arises out of an accidental error and confusion,
3412 and that they do not really hate those who love them, if they could be
3413 educated to know them.
3414 
3415 In the latter part of the sixth book, three questions have to be
3416 considered: 1st, the nature of the longer and more circuitous way, which
3417 is contrasted with the shorter and more imperfect method of Book IV;
3418 2nd, the heavenly pattern or idea of the state; 3rd, the relation of the
3419 divisions of knowledge to one another and to the corresponding faculties
3420 of the soul:
3421 
3422 1. Of the higher method of knowledge in Plato we have only a glimpse.
3423 Neither here nor in the Phaedrus or Symposium, nor yet in the Philebus
3424 or Sophist, does he give any clear explanation of his meaning. He would
3425 probably have described his method as proceeding by regular steps to a
3426 system of universal knowledge, which inferred the parts from the whole
3427 rather than the whole from the parts. This ideal logic is not practised
3428 by him in the search after justice, or in the analysis of the parts of
3429 the soul; there, like Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics, he argues
3430 from experience and the common use of language. But at the end of the
3431 sixth book he conceives another and more perfect method, in which
3432 all ideas are only steps or grades or moments of thought, forming a
3433 connected whole which is self-supporting, and in which consistency is
3434 the test of truth. He does not explain to us in detail the nature of the
3435 process. Like many other thinkers both in ancient and modern times
3436 his mind seems to be filled with a vacant form which he is unable to
3437 realize. He supposes the sciences to have a natural order and connexion
3438 in an age when they can hardly be said to exist. He is hastening on to
3439 the 'end of the intellectual world' without even making a beginning of
3440 them.
3441 
3442 In modern times we hardly need to be reminded that the process of
3443 acquiring knowledge is here confused with the contemplation of absolute
3444 knowledge. In all science a priori and a posteriori truths mingle in
3445 various proportions. The a priori part is that which is derived from the
3446 most universal experience of men, or is universally accepted by
3447 them; the a posteriori is that which grows up around the more
3448 general principles and becomes imperceptibly one with them. But Plato
3449 erroneously imagines that the synthesis is separable from the analysis,
3450 and that the method of science can anticipate science. In entertaining
3451 such a vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified, or at
3452 least his meaning may be sufficiently explained by the similar attempts
3453 of Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and even of Bacon himself, in modern
3454 philosophy. Anticipations or divinations, or prophetic glimpses of
3455 truths whether concerning man or nature, seem to stand in the same
3456 relation to ancient philosophy which hypotheses bear to modern inductive
3457 science. These 'guesses at truth' were not made at random; they arose
3458 from a superficial impression of uniformities and first principles
3459 in nature which the genius of the Greek, contemplating the expanse of
3460 heaven and earth, seemed to recognize in the distance. Nor can we deny
3461 that in ancient times knowledge must have stood still, and the human
3462 mind been deprived of the very instruments of thought, if philosophy had
3463 been strictly confined to the results of experience.
3464 
3465 2. Plato supposes that when the tablet has been made blank the artist
3466 will fill in the lineaments of the ideal state. Is this a pattern laid
3467 up in heaven, or mere vacancy on which he is supposed to gaze with
3468 wondering eye? The answer is, that such ideals are framed partly by the
3469 omission of particulars, partly by imagination perfecting the form which
3470 experience supplies (Phaedo). Plato represents these ideals in a
3471 figure as belonging to another world; and in modern times the idea will
3472 sometimes seem to precede, at other times to co-operate with the hand
3473 of the artist. As in science, so also in creative art, there is a
3474 synthetical as well as an analytical method. One man will have the whole
3475 in his mind before he begins; to another the processes of mind and hand
3476 will be simultaneous.
3477 
3478 3. There is no difficulty in seeing that Plato's divisions of knowledge
3479 are based, first, on the fundamental antithesis of sensible and
3480 intellectual which pervades the whole pre-Socratic philosophy; in which
3481 is implied also the opposition of the permanent and transient, of the
3482 universal and particular. But the age of philosophy in which he lived
3483 seemed to require a further distinction;--numbers and figures were
3484 beginning to separate from ideas. The world could no longer regard
3485 justice as a cube, and was learning to see, though imperfectly, that
3486 the abstractions of sense were distinct from the abstractions of mind.
3487 Between the Eleatic being or essence and the shadows of phenomena, the
3488 Pythagorean principle of number found a place, and was, as Aristotle
3489 remarks, a conducting medium from one to the other. Hence Plato is led
3490 to introduce a third term which had not hitherto entered into the scheme
3491 of his philosophy. He had observed the use of mathematics in education;
3492 they were the best preparation for higher studies. The subjective
3493 relation between them further suggested an objective one; although
3494 the passage from one to the other is really imaginary (Metaph.). For
3495 metaphysical and moral philosophy has no connexion with mathematics;
3496 number and figure are the abstractions of time and space, not the
3497 expressions of purely intellectual conceptions. When divested of
3498 metaphor, a straight line or a square has no more to do with right and
3499 justice than a crooked line with vice. The figurative association was
3500 mistaken for a real one; and thus the three latter divisions of the
3501 Platonic proportion were constructed.
3502 
3503 There is more difficulty in comprehending how he arrived at the
3504 first term of the series, which is nowhere else mentioned, and has no
3505 reference to any other part of his system. Nor indeed does the relation
3506 of shadows to objects correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas.
3507 Probably Plato has been led by the love of analogy (Timaeus) to make
3508 four terms instead of three, although the objects perceived in both
3509 divisions of the lower sphere are equally objects of sense. He is also
3510 preparing the way, as his manner is, for the shadows of images at the
3511 beginning of the seventh book, and the imitation of an imitation in the
3512 tenth. The line may be regarded as reaching from unity to infinity, and
3513 is divided into two unequal parts, and subdivided into two more;
3514 each lower sphere is the multiplication of the preceding. Of the four
3515 faculties, faith in the lower division has an intermediate position (cp.
3516 for the use of the word faith or belief, (Greek), Timaeus), contrasting
3517 equally with the vagueness of the perception of shadows (Greek) and the
3518 higher certainty of understanding (Greek) and reason (Greek).
3519 
3520 The difference between understanding and mind or reason (Greek) is
3521 analogous to the difference between acquiring knowledge in the parts
3522 and the contemplation of the whole. True knowledge is a whole, and is
3523 at rest; consistency and universality are the tests of truth. To this
3524 self-evidencing knowledge of the whole the faculty of mind is supposed
3525 to correspond. But there is a knowledge of the understanding which
3526 is incomplete and in motion always, because unable to rest in
3527 the subordinate ideas. Those ideas are called both images and
3528 hypotheses--images because they are clothed in sense, hypotheses because
3529 they are assumptions only, until they are brought into connexion with
3530 the idea of good.
3531 
3532 The general meaning of the passage, 'Noble, then, is the bond which
3533 links together sight...And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible...'
3534 so far as the thought contained in it admits of being translated
3535 into the terms of modern philosophy, may be described or explained as
3536 follows:--There is a truth, one and self-existent, to which by the help
3537 of a ladder let down from above, the human intelligence may ascend. This
3538 unity is like the sun in the heavens, the light by which all things are
3539 seen, the being by which they are created and sustained. It is the
3540 IDEA of good. And the steps of the ladder leading up to this highest or
3541 universal existence are the mathematical sciences, which also contain
3542 in themselves an element of the universal. These, too, we see in a new
3543 manner when we connect them with the idea of good. They then cease to
3544 be hypotheses or pictures, and become essential parts of a higher truth
3545 which is at once their first principle and their final cause.
3546 
3547 We cannot give any more precise meaning to this remarkable passage, but
3548 we may trace in it several rudiments or vestiges of thought which are
3549 common to us and to Plato: such as (1) the unity and correlation of the
3550 sciences, or rather of science, for in Plato's time they were not yet
3551 parted off or distinguished; (2) the existence of a Divine Power,
3552 or life or idea or cause or reason, not yet conceived or no longer
3553 conceived as in the Timaeus and elsewhere under the form of a person;
3554 (3) the recognition of the hypothetical and conditional character of the
3555 mathematical sciences, and in a measure of every science when isolated
3556 from the rest; (4) the conviction of a truth which is invisible, and of
3557 a law, though hardly a law of nature, which permeates the intellectual
3558 rather than the visible world.
3559 
3560 The method of Socrates is hesitating and tentative, awaiting the fuller
3561 explanation of the idea of good, and of the nature of dialectic in the
3562 seventh book. The imperfect intelligence of Glaucon, and the reluctance
3563 of Socrates to make a beginning, mark the difficulty of the subject.
3564 The allusion to Theages' bridle, and to the internal oracle, or demonic
3565 sign, of Socrates, which here, as always in Plato, is only prohibitory;
3566 the remark that the salvation of any remnant of good in the present evil
3567 state of the world is due to God only; the reference to a future state
3568 of existence, which is unknown to Glaucon in the tenth book, and in
3569 which the discussions of Socrates and his disciples would be resumed;
3570 the surprise in the answers; the fanciful irony of Socrates, where
3571 he pretends that he can only describe the strange position of the
3572 philosopher in a figure of speech; the original observation that the
3573 Sophists, after all, are only the representatives and not the leaders
3574 of public opinion; the picture of the philosopher standing aside in the
3575 shower of sleet under a wall; the figure of 'the great beast' followed
3576 by the expression of good-will towards the common people who would not
3577 have rejected the philosopher if they had known him; the 'right noble
3578 thought' that the highest truths demand the greatest exactness; the
3579 hesitation of Socrates in returning once more to his well-worn theme of
3580 the idea of good; the ludicrous earnestness of Glaucon; the comparison
3581 of philosophy to a deserted maiden who marries beneath her--are some of
3582 the most interesting characteristics of the sixth book.
3583 
3584 Yet a few more words may be added, on the old theme, which was so
3585 oft discussed in the Socratic circle, of which we, like Glaucon and
3586 Adeimantus, would fain, if possible, have a clearer notion. Like them,
3587 we are dissatisfied when we are told that the idea of good can only be
3588 revealed to a student of the mathematical sciences, and we are inclined
3589 to think that neither we nor they could have been led along that path to
3590 any satisfactory goal. For we have learned that differences of quantity
3591 cannot pass into differences of quality, and that the mathematical
3592 sciences can never rise above themselves into the sphere of our higher
3593 thoughts, although they may sometimes furnish symbols and expressions
3594 of them, and may train the mind in habits of abstraction and
3595 self-concentration. The illusion which was natural to an ancient
3596 philosopher has ceased to be an illusion to us. But if the process by
3597 which we are supposed to arrive at the idea of good be really imaginary,
3598 may not the idea itself be also a mere abstraction? We remark, first,
3599 that in all ages, and especially in primitive philosophy, words such
3600 as being, essence, unity, good, have exerted an extraordinary influence
3601 over the minds of men. The meagreness or negativeness of their content
3602 has been in an inverse ratio to their power. They have become the forms
3603 under which all things were comprehended. There was a need or instinct
3604 in the human soul which they satisfied; they were not ideas, but gods,
3605 and to this new mythology the men of a later generation began to attach
3606 the powers and associations of the elder deities.
3607 
3608 The idea of good is one of those sacred words or forms of thought, which
3609 were beginning to take the place of the old mythology. It meant unity,
3610 in which all time and all existence were gathered up. It was the truth
3611 of all things, and also the light in which they shone forth, and became
3612 evident to intelligences human and divine. It was the cause of all
3613 things, the power by which they were brought into being. It was the
3614 universal reason divested of a human personality. It was the life
3615 as well as the light of the world, all knowledge and all power were
3616 comprehended in it. The way to it was through the mathematical sciences,
3617 and these too were dependent on it. To ask whether God was the maker of
3618 it, or made by it, would be like asking whether God could be conceived
3619 apart from goodness, or goodness apart from God. The God of the Timaeus
3620 is not really at variance with the idea of good; they are aspects of
3621 the same, differing only as the personal from the impersonal, or the
3622 masculine from the neuter, the one being the expression or language of
3623 mythology, the other of philosophy.
3624 
3625 This, or something like this, is the meaning of the idea of good as
3626 conceived by Plato. Ideas of number, order, harmony, development may
3627 also be said to enter into it. The paraphrase which has just been given
3628 of it goes beyond the actual words of Plato. We have perhaps arrived at
3629 the stage of philosophy which enables us to understand what he is aiming
3630 at, better than he did himself. We are beginning to realize what he saw
3631 darkly and at a distance. But if he could have been told that this, or
3632 some conception of the same kind, but higher than this, was the truth
3633 at which he was aiming, and the need which he sought to supply, he would
3634 gladly have recognized that more was contained in his own thoughts
3635 than he himself knew. As his words are few and his manner reticent
3636 and tentative, so must the style of his interpreter be. We should not
3637 approach his meaning more nearly by attempting to define it further. In
3638 translating him into the language of modern thought, we might insensibly
3639 lose the spirit of ancient philosophy. It is remarkable that although
3640 Plato speaks of the idea of good as the first principle of truth and
3641 being, it is nowhere mentioned in his writings except in this passage.
3642 Nor did it retain any hold upon the minds of his disciples in a later
3643 generation; it was probably unintelligible to them. Nor does the mention
3644 of it in Aristotle appear to have any reference to this or any other
3645 passage in his extant writings.
3646 
3647 BOOK VII. And now I will describe in a figure the enlightenment or
3648 unenlightenment of our nature:--Imagine human beings living in an
3649 underground den which is open towards the light; they have been there
3650 from childhood, having their necks and legs chained, and can only see
3651 into the den. At a distance there is a fire, and between the fire and
3652 the prisoners a raised way, and a low wall is built along the way, like
3653 the screen over which marionette players show their puppets. Behind the
3654 wall appear moving figures, who hold in their hands various works of
3655 art, and among them images of men and animals, wood and stone, and some
3656 of the passers-by are talking and others silent. 'A strange parable,'
3657 he said, 'and strange captives.' They are ourselves, I replied; and they
3658 see only the shadows of the images which the fire throws on the wall of
3659 the den; to these they give names, and if we add an echo which returns
3660 from the wall, the voices of the passengers will seem to proceed from
3661 the shadows. Suppose now that you suddenly turn them round and make them
3662 look with pain and grief to themselves at the real images; will they
3663 believe them to be real? Will not their eyes be dazzled, and will they
3664 not try to get away from the light to something which they are able to
3665 behold without blinking? And suppose further, that they are dragged up
3666 a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself, will not
3667 their sight be darkened with the excess of light? Some time will pass
3668 before they get the habit of perceiving at all; and at first they will
3669 be able to perceive only shadows and reflections in the water; then they
3670 will recognize the moon and the stars, and will at length behold the sun
3671 in his own proper place as he is. Last of all they will conclude:--This
3672 is he who gives us the year and the seasons, and is the author of all
3673 that we see. How will they rejoice in passing from darkness to light!
3674 How worthless to them will seem the honours and glories of the den! But
3675 now imagine further, that they descend into their old habitations;--in
3676 that underground dwelling they will not see as well as their fellows,
3677 and will not be able to compete with them in the measurement of the
3678 shadows on the wall; there will be many jokes about the man who went on
3679 a visit to the sun and lost his eyes, and if they find anybody trying to
3680 set free and enlighten one of their number, they will put him to death,
3681 if they can catch him. Now the cave or den is the world of sight, the
3682 fire is the sun, the way upwards is the way to knowledge, and in the
3683 world of knowledge the idea of good is last seen and with difficulty,
3684 but when seen is inferred to be the author of good and right--parent of
3685 the lord of light in this world, and of truth and understanding in the
3686 other. He who attains to the beatific vision is always going upwards; he
3687 is unwilling to descend into political assemblies and courts of law; for
3688 his eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of images which they
3689 behold in them--he cannot enter into the ideas of those who have never
3690 in their lives understood the relation of the shadow to the substance.
3691 But blindness is of two kinds, and may be caused either by passing out
3692 of darkness into light or out of light into darkness, and a man of sense
3693 will distinguish between them, and will not laugh equally at both of
3694 them, but the blindness which arises from fulness of light he will deem
3695 blessed, and pity the other; or if he laugh at the puzzled soul looking
3696 at the sun, he will have more reason to laugh than the inhabitants
3697 of the den at those who descend from above. There is a further lesson
3698 taught by this parable of ours. Some persons fancy that instruction is
3699 like giving eyes to the blind, but we say that the faculty of sight was
3700 always there, and that the soul only requires to be turned round towards
3701 the light. And this is conversion; other virtues are almost like bodily
3702 habits, and may be acquired in the same manner, but intelligence has
3703 a diviner life, and is indestructible, turning either to good or evil
3704 according to the direction given. Did you never observe how the mind of
3705 a clever rogue peers out of his eyes, and the more clearly he sees, the
3706 more evil he does? Now if you take such an one, and cut away from him
3707 those leaden weights of pleasure and desire which bind his soul to
3708 earth, his intelligence will be turned round, and he will behold the
3709 truth as clearly as he now discerns his meaner ends. And have we not
3710 decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no
3711 fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to be unwilling to leave
3712 their paradise for the business of the world? We must choose out
3713 therefore the natures who are most likely to ascend to the light and
3714 knowledge of the good; but we must not allow them to remain in the
3715 region of light; they must be forced down again among the captives in
3716 the den to partake of their labours and honours. 'Will they not think
3717 this a hardship?' You should remember that our purpose in framing the
3718 State was not that our citizens should do what they like, but that they
3719 should serve the State for the common good of all. May we not fairly
3720 say to our philosopher,--Friend, we do you no wrong; for in other States
3721 philosophy grows wild, and a wild plant owes nothing to the gardener,
3722 but you have been trained by us to be the rulers and kings of our hive,
3723 and therefore we must insist on your descending into the den. You must,
3724 each of you, take your turn, and become able to use your eyes in the
3725 dark, and with a little practice you will see far better than those who
3726 quarrel about the shadows, whose knowledge is a dream only, whilst yours
3727 is a waking reality. It may be that the saint or philosopher who is best
3728 fitted, may also be the least inclined to rule, but necessity is laid
3729 upon him, and he must no longer live in the heaven of ideas. And this
3730 will be the salvation of the State. For those who rule must not be those
3731 who are desirous to rule; and, if you can offer to our citizens a better
3732 life than that of rulers generally is, there will be a chance that the
3733 rich, not only in this world's goods, but in virtue and wisdom, may
3734 bear rule. And the only life which is better than the life of political
3735 ambition is that of philosophy, which is also the best preparation for
3736 the government of a State.
3737 
3738 Then now comes the question,--How shall we create our rulers; what way
3739 is there from darkness to light? The change is effected by philosophy;
3740 it is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but the conversion of a
3741 soul from night to day, from becoming to being. And what training will
3742 draw the soul upwards? Our former education had two branches, gymnastic,
3743 which was occupied with the body, and music, the sister art, which
3744 infused a natural harmony into mind and literature; but neither of these
3745 sciences gave any promise of doing what we want. Nothing remains to us
3746 but that universal or primary science of which all the arts and sciences
3747 are partakers, I mean number or calculation. 'Very true.' Including the
3748 art of war? 'Yes, certainly.' Then there is something ludicrous about
3749 Palamedes in the tragedy, coming in and saying that he had invented
3750 number, and had counted the ranks and set them in order. For if
3751 Agamemnon could not count his feet (and without number how could he?)
3752 he must have been a pretty sort of general indeed. No man should be a
3753 soldier who cannot count, and indeed he is hardly to be called a man.
3754 But I am not speaking of these practical applications of arithmetic, for
3755 number, in my view, is rather to be regarded as a conductor to thought
3756 and being. I will explain what I mean by the last expression:--Things
3757 sensible are of two kinds; the one class invite or stimulate the mind,
3758 while in the other the mind acquiesces. Now the stimulating class are
3759 the things which suggest contrast and relation. For example, suppose
3760 that I hold up to the eyes three fingers--a fore finger, a middle
3761 finger, a little finger--the sight equally recognizes all three fingers,
3762 but without number cannot further distinguish them. Or again, suppose
3763 two objects to be relatively great and small, these ideas of greatness
3764 and smallness are supplied not by the sense, but by the mind. And the
3765 perception of their contrast or relation quickens and sets in motion
3766 the mind, which is puzzled by the confused intimations of sense, and has
3767 recourse to number in order to find out whether the things indicated are
3768 one or more than one. Number replies that they are two and not one, and
3769 are to be distinguished from one another. Again, the sight beholds
3770 great and small, but only in a confused chaos, and not until they are
3771 distinguished does the question arise of their respective natures; we
3772 are thus led on to the distinction between the visible and intelligible.
3773 That was what I meant when I spoke of stimulants to the intellect; I was
3774 thinking of the contradictions which arise in perception. The idea
3775 of unity, for example, like that of a finger, does not arouse thought
3776 unless involving some conception of plurality; but when the one is also
3777 the opposite of one, the contradiction gives rise to reflection; an
3778 example of this is afforded by any object of sight. All number has also
3779 an elevating effect; it raises the mind out of the foam and flux of
3780 generation to the contemplation of being, having lesser military and
3781 retail uses also. The retail use is not required by us; but as our
3782 guardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosopher, the military one
3783 may be retained. And to our higher purpose no science can be better
3784 adapted; but it must be pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, not of a
3785 shopkeeper. It is concerned, not with visible objects, but with abstract
3786 truth; for numbers are pure abstractions--the true arithmetician
3787 indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division. When you
3788 divide, he insists that you are only multiplying; his 'one' is not
3789 material or resolvable into fractions, but an unvarying and absolute
3790 equality; and this proves the purely intellectual character of his
3791 study. Note also the great power which arithmetic has of sharpening the
3792 wits; no other discipline is equally severe, or an equal test of general
3793 ability, or equally improving to a stupid person.
3794 
3795 Let our second branch of education be geometry. 'I can easily see,'
3796 replied Glaucon, 'that the skill of the general will be doubled by his
3797 knowledge of geometry.' That is a small matter; the use of geometry, to
3798 which I refer, is the assistance given by it in the contemplation of the
3799 idea of good, and the compelling the mind to look at true being, and not
3800 at generation only. Yet the present mode of pursuing these studies,
3801 as any one who is the least of a mathematician is aware, is mean and
3802 ridiculous; they are made to look downwards to the arts, and not upwards
3803 to eternal existence. The geometer is always talking of squaring,
3804 subtending, apposing, as if he had in view action; whereas knowledge is
3805 the real object of the study. It should elevate the soul, and create
3806 the mind of philosophy; it should raise up what has fallen down, not to
3807 speak of lesser uses in war and military tactics, and in the improvement
3808 of the faculties.
3809 
3810 Shall we propose, as a third branch of our education, astronomy? 'Very
3811 good,' replied Glaucon; 'the knowledge of the heavens is necessary at
3812 once for husbandry, navigation, military tactics.' I like your way of
3813 giving useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the
3814 world. And there is a difficulty in proving to mankind that education is
3815 not only useful information but a purification of the eye of the soul,
3816 which is better than the bodily eye, for by this alone is truth seen.
3817 Now, will you appeal to mankind in general or to the philosopher? or
3818 would you prefer to look to yourself only? 'Every man is his own best
3819 friend.' Then take a step backward, for we are out of order, and insert
3820 the third dimension which is of solids, after the second which is of
3821 planes, and then you may proceed to solids in motion. But solid geometry
3822 is not popular and has not the patronage of the State, nor is the use
3823 of it fully recognized; the difficulty is great, and the votaries of the
3824 study are conceited and impatient. Still the charm of the pursuit wins
3825 upon men, and, if government would lend a little assistance, there
3826 might be great progress made. 'Very true,' replied Glaucon; 'but do
3827 I understand you now to begin with plane geometry, and to place next
3828 geometry of solids, and thirdly, astronomy, or the motion of solids?'
3829 Yes, I said; my hastiness has only hindered us.
3830 
3831 'Very good, and now let us proceed to astronomy, about which I am
3832 willing to speak in your lofty strain. No one can fail to see that the
3833 contemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards.' I am an exception,
3834 then; astronomy as studied at present appears to me to draw the soul
3835 not upwards, but downwards. Star-gazing is just looking up at the
3836 ceiling--no better; a man may lie on his back on land or on water--he
3837 may look up or look down, but there is no science in that. The vision of
3838 knowledge of which I speak is seen not with the eyes, but with the mind.
3839 All the magnificence of the heavens is but the embroidery of a copy
3840 which falls far short of the divine Original, and teaches nothing about
3841 the absolute harmonies or motions of things. Their beauty is like the
3842 beauty of figures drawn by the hand of Daedalus or any other great
3843 artist, which may be used for illustration, but no mathematician would
3844 seek to obtain from them true conceptions of equality or numerical
3845 relations. How ridiculous then to look for these in the map of the
3846 heavens, in which the imperfection of matter comes in everywhere as a
3847 disturbing element, marring the symmetry of day and night, of months and
3848 years, of the sun and stars in their courses. Only by problems can we
3849 place astronomy on a truly scientific basis. Let the heavens alone, and
3850 exert the intellect.
3851 
3852 Still, mathematics admit of other applications, as the Pythagoreans say,
3853 and we agree. There is a sister science of harmonical motion, adapted to
3854 the ear as astronomy is to the eye, and there may be other applications
3855 also. Let us inquire of the Pythagoreans about them, not forgetting
3856 that we have an aim higher than theirs, which is the relation of these
3857 sciences to the idea of good. The error which pervades astronomy also
3858 pervades harmonics. The musicians put their ears in the place of their
3859 minds. 'Yes,' replied Glaucon, 'I like to see them laying their ears
3860 alongside of their neighbours' faces--some saying, "That's a new note,"
3861 others declaring that the two notes are the same.' Yes, I said; but you
3862 mean the empirics who are always twisting and torturing the strings
3863 of the lyre, and quarrelling about the tempers of the strings; I am
3864 referring rather to the Pythagorean harmonists, who are almost equally
3865 in error. For they investigate only the numbers of the consonances which
3866 are heard, and ascend no higher,--of the true numerical harmony which
3867 is unheard, and is only to be found in problems, they have not even a
3868 conception. 'That last,' he said, 'must be a marvellous thing.' A thing,
3869 I replied, which is only useful if pursued with a view to the good.
3870 
3871 All these sciences are the prelude of the strain, and are profitable
3872 if they are regarded in their natural relations to one another. 'I
3873 dare say, Socrates,' said Glaucon; 'but such a study will be an endless
3874 business.' What study do you mean--of the prelude, or what? For all
3875 these things are only the prelude, and you surely do not suppose that a
3876 mere mathematician is also a dialectician? 'Certainly not. I have hardly
3877 ever known a mathematician who could reason.' And yet, Glaucon, is
3878 not true reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the
3879 intellectual world, and which was by us compared to the effort of sight,
3880 when from beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last at
3881 the images which gave the shadows? Even so the dialectical faculty
3882 withdrawing from sense arrives by the pure intellect at the
3883 contemplation of the idea of good, and never rests but at the very end
3884 of the intellectual world. And the royal road out of the cave into
3885 the light, and the blinking of the eyes at the sun and turning to
3886 contemplate the shadows of reality, not the shadows of an image
3887 only--this progress and gradual acquisition of a new faculty of sight by
3888 the help of the mathematical sciences, is the elevation of the soul to
3889 the contemplation of the highest ideal of being.
3890 
3891 'So far, I agree with you. But now, leaving the prelude, let us proceed
3892 to the hymn. What, then, is the nature of dialectic, and what are the
3893 paths which lead thither?' Dear Glaucon, you cannot follow me here.
3894 There can be no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not been
3895 disciplined in the previous sciences. But that there is a science of
3896 absolute truth, which is attained in some way very different from
3897 those now practised, I am confident. For all other arts or sciences are
3898 relative to human needs and opinions; and the mathematical sciences are
3899 but a dream or hypothesis of true being, and never analyse their own
3900 principles. Dialectic alone rises to the principle which is above
3901 hypotheses, converting and gently leading the eye of the soul out of the
3902 barbarous slough of ignorance into the light of the upper world, with
3903 the help of the sciences which we have been describing--sciences, as
3904 they are often termed, although they require some other name, implying
3905 greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science, and this
3906 in our previous sketch was understanding. And so we get four names--two
3907 for intellect, and two for opinion,--reason or mind, understanding,
3908 faith, perception of shadows--which make a proportion--
3909 being:becoming::intellect:opinion--and science:belief::understanding:
3910 perception of shadows. Dialectic may be further described as that
3911 science which defines and explains the essence or being of each nature,
3912 which distinguishes and abstracts the good, and is ready to do battle
3913 against all opponents in the cause of good. To him who is not a
3914 dialectician life is but a sleepy dream; and many a man is in his grave
3915 before his is well waked up. And would you have the future rulers of
3916 your ideal State intelligent beings, or stupid as posts? 'Certainly not
3917 the latter.' Then you must train them in dialectic, which will teach
3918 them to ask and answer questions, and is the coping-stone of the
3919 sciences.
3920 
3921 I dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen; and
3922 the process of selection may be carried a step further:--As before, they
3923 must be constant and valiant, good-looking, and of noble manners, but
3924 now they must also have natural ability which education will improve;
3925 that is to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil,
3926 retentive, solid, diligent natures, who combine intellectual with
3927 moral virtues; not lame and one-sided, diligent in bodily exercise
3928 and indolent in mind, or conversely; not a maimed soul, which hates
3929 falsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of
3930 ignorance; not a bastard or feeble person, but sound in wind and limb,
3931 and in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind.
3932 Justice herself can find no fault with natures such as these; and they
3933 will be the saviours of our State; disciples of another sort would
3934 only make philosophy more ridiculous than she is at present. Forgive
3935 my enthusiasm; I am becoming excited; but when I see her trampled
3936 underfoot, I am angry at the authors of her disgrace. 'I did not notice
3937 that you were more excited than you ought to have been.' But I felt that
3938 I was. Now do not let us forget another point in the selection of our
3939 disciples--that they must be young and not old. For Solon is mistaken
3940 in saying that an old man can be always learning; youth is the time of
3941 study, and here we must remember that the mind is free and dainty, and,
3942 unlike the body, must not be made to work against the grain. Learning
3943 should be at first a sort of play, in which the natural bent is
3944 detected. As in training them for war, the young dogs should at first
3945 only taste blood; but when the necessary gymnastics are over which
3946 during two or three years divide life between sleep and bodily exercise,
3947 then the education of the soul will become a more serious matter. At
3948 twenty years of age, a selection must be made of the more promising
3949 disciples, with whom a new epoch of education will begin. The sciences
3950 which they have hitherto learned in fragments will now be brought into
3951 relation with each other and with true being; for the power of combining
3952 them is the test of speculative and dialectical ability. And afterwards
3953 at thirty a further selection shall be made of those who are able to
3954 withdraw from the world of sense into the abstraction of ideas. But
3955 at this point, judging from present experience, there is a danger that
3956 dialectic may be the source of many evils. The danger may be illustrated
3957 by a parallel case:--Imagine a person who has been brought up in wealth
3958 and luxury amid a crowd of flatterers, and who is suddenly informed that
3959 he is a supposititious son. He has hitherto honoured his reputed parents
3960 and disregarded the flatterers, and now he does the reverse. This is
3961 just what happens with a man's principles. There are certain doctrines
3962 which he learnt at home and which exercised a parental authority
3963 over him. Presently he finds that imputations are cast upon them; a
3964 troublesome querist comes and asks, 'What is the just and good?'
3965 or proves that virtue is vice and vice virtue, and his mind becomes
3966 unsettled, and he ceases to love, honour, and obey them as he has
3967 hitherto done. He is seduced into the life of pleasure, and becomes
3968 a lawless person and a rogue. The case of such speculators is very
3969 pitiable, and, in order that our thirty years' old pupils may not
3970 require this pity, let us take every possible care that young persons do
3971 not study philosophy too early. For a young man is a sort of puppy
3972 who only plays with an argument; and is reasoned into and out of his
3973 opinions every day; he soon begins to believe nothing, and brings
3974 himself and philosophy into discredit. A man of thirty does not run
3975 on in this way; he will argue and not merely contradict, and adds new
3976 honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his conduct. What time shall we
3977 allow for this second gymnastic training of the soul?--say, twice the
3978 time required for the gymnastics of the body; six, or perhaps five
3979 years, to commence at thirty, and then for fifteen years let the student
3980 go down into the den, and command armies, and gain experience of life.
3981 At fifty let him return to the end of all things, and have his eyes
3982 uplifted to the idea of good, and order his life after that pattern; if
3983 necessary, taking his turn at the helm of State, and training up others
3984 to be his successors. When his time comes he shall depart in peace to
3985 the islands of the blest. He shall be honoured with sacrifices, and
3986 receive such worship as the Pythian oracle approves.
3987 
3988 'You are a statuary, Socrates, and have made a perfect image of our
3989 governors.' Yes, and of our governesses, for the women will share in
3990 all things with the men. And you will admit that our State is not a
3991 mere aspiration, but may really come into being when there shall arise
3992 philosopher-kings, one or more, who will despise earthly vanities, and
3993 will be the servants of justice only. 'And how will they begin their
3994 work?' Their first act will be to send away into the country all those
3995 who are more than ten years of age, and to proceed with those who are
3996 left...
3997 
3998 At the commencement of the sixth book, Plato anticipated his explanation
3999 of the relation of the philosopher to the world in an allegory, in
4000 this, as in other passages, following the order which he prescribes
4001 in education, and proceeding from the concrete to the abstract. At the
4002 commencement of Book VII, under the figure of a cave having an opening
4003 towards a fire and a way upwards to the true light, he returns to view
4004 the divisions of knowledge, exhibiting familiarly, as in a picture, the
4005 result which had been hardly won by a great effort of thought in the
4006 previous discussion; at the same time casting a glance onward at the
4007 dialectical process, which is represented by the way leading from
4008 darkness to light. The shadows, the images, the reflection of the
4009 sun and stars in the water, the stars and sun themselves, severally
4010 correspond,--the first, to the realm of fancy and poetry,--the second,
4011 to the world of sense,--the third, to the abstractions or universals of
4012 sense, of which the mathematical sciences furnish the type,--the fourth
4013 and last to the same abstractions, when seen in the unity of the idea,
4014 from which they derive a new meaning and power. The true dialectical
4015 process begins with the contemplation of the real stars, and not mere
4016 reflections of them, and ends with the recognition of the sun, or idea
4017 of good, as the parent not only of light but of warmth and growth.
4018 To the divisions of knowledge the stages of education partly
4019 answer:--first, there is the early education of childhood and youth
4020 in the fancies of the poets, and in the laws and customs of the
4021 State;--then there is the training of the body to be a warrior athlete,
4022 and a good servant of the mind;--and thirdly, after an interval follows
4023 the education of later life, which begins with mathematics and proceeds
4024 to philosophy in general.
4025 
4026 There seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of Plato,--first, to
4027 realize abstractions; secondly, to connect them. According to him, the
4028 true education is that which draws men from becoming to being, and to
4029 a comprehensive survey of all being. He desires to develop in the human
4030 mind the faculty of seeing the universal in all things; until at last
4031 the particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains. He
4032 then seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from sense,
4033 not perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis but the
4034 common use of language. He never understands that abstractions, as Hegel
4035 says, are 'mere abstractions'--of use when employed in the arrangement
4036 of facts, but adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when pursued apart
4037 from them, or with reference to an imaginary idea of good. Still the
4038 exercise of the faculty of abstraction apart from facts has enlarged the
4039 mind, and played a great part in the education of the human race.
4040 Plato appreciated the value of this faculty, and saw that it might be
4041 quickened by the study of number and relation. All things in which
4042 there is opposition or proportion are suggestive of reflection. The
4043 mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or of mind, but when
4044 sensible objects ask to be compared and distinguished, then philosophy
4045 begins. The science of arithmetic first suggests such distinctions. The
4046 follow in order the other sciences of plain and solid geometry, and of
4047 solids in motion, one branch of which is astronomy or the harmony of
4048 the spheres,--to this is appended the sister science of the harmony
4049 of sounds. Plato seems also to hint at the possibility of other
4050 applications of arithmetical or mathematical proportions, such as we
4051 employ in chemistry and natural philosophy, such as the Pythagoreans and
4052 even Aristotle make use of in Ethics and Politics, e.g. his distinction
4053 between arithmetical and geometrical proportion in the Ethics (Book V),
4054 or between numerical and proportional equality in the Politics.
4055 
4056 The modern mathematician will readily sympathise with Plato's delight
4057 in the properties of pure mathematics. He will not be disinclined to say
4058 with him:--Let alone the heavens, and study the beauties of number and
4059 figure in themselves. He too will be apt to depreciate their application
4060 to the arts. He will observe that Plato has a conception of geometry,
4061 in which figures are to be dispensed with; thus in a distant and
4062 shadowy way seeming to anticipate the possibility of working geometrical
4063 problems by a more general mode of analysis. He will remark with
4064 interest on the backward state of solid geometry, which, alas! was not
4065 encouraged by the aid of the State in the age of Plato; and he will
4066 recognize the grasp of Plato's mind in his ability to conceive of
4067 one science of solids in motion including the earth as well as the
4068 heavens,--not forgetting to notice the intimation to which allusion has
4069 been already made, that besides astronomy and harmonics the science
4070 of solids in motion may have other applications. Still more will he be
4071 struck with the comprehensiveness of view which led Plato, at a time
4072 when these sciences hardly existed, to say that they must be studied in
4073 relation to one another, and to the idea of good, or common principle
4074 of truth and being. But he will also see (and perhaps without surprise)
4075 that in that stage of physical and mathematical knowledge, Plato has
4076 fallen into the error of supposing that he can construct the heavens a
4077 priori by mathematical problems, and determine the principles of harmony
4078 irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the human ear. The illusion
4079 was a natural one in that age and country. The simplicity and certainty
4080 of astronomy and harmonics seemed to contrast with the variation and
4081 complexity of the world of sense; hence the circumstance that there was
4082 some elementary basis of fact, some measurement of distance or time or
4083 vibrations on which they must ultimately rest, was overlooked by him.
4084 The modern predecessors of Newton fell into errors equally great; and
4085 Plato can hardly be said to have been very far wrong, or may even claim
4086 a sort of prophetic insight into the subject, when we consider that
4087 the greater part of astronomy at the present day consists of abstract
4088 dynamics, by the help of which most astronomical discoveries have been
4089 made.
4090 
4091 The metaphysical philosopher from his point of view recognizes
4092 mathematics as an instrument of education,--which strengthens the
4093 power of attention, developes the sense of order and the faculty of
4094 construction, and enables the mind to grasp under simple formulae the
4095 quantitative differences of physical phenomena. But while acknowledging
4096 their value in education, he sees also that they have no connexion with
4097 our higher moral and intellectual ideas. In the attempt which Plato
4098 makes to connect them, we easily trace the influences of ancient
4099 Pythagorean notions. There is no reason to suppose that he is speaking
4100 of the ideal numbers; but he is describing numbers which are pure
4101 abstractions, to which he assigns a real and separate existence, which,
4102 as 'the teachers of the art' (meaning probably the Pythagoreans) would
4103 have affirmed, repel all attempts at subdivision, and in which unity and
4104 every other number are conceived of as absolute. The truth and certainty
4105 of numbers, when thus disengaged from phenomena, gave them a kind of
4106 sacredness in the eyes of an ancient philosopher. Nor is it easy to say
4107 how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral and elevating
4108 influence on the minds of men, 'who,' in the words of the Timaeus,
4109 'might learn to regulate their erring lives according to them.' It is
4110 worthy of remark that the old Pythagorean ethical symbols still exist as
4111 figures of speech among ourselves. And those who in modern times see the
4112 world pervaded by universal law, may also see an anticipation of this
4113 last word of modern philosophy in the Platonic idea of good, which
4114 is the source and measure of all things, and yet only an abstraction
4115 (Philebus).
4116 
4117 Two passages seem to require more particular explanations. First, that
4118 which relates to the analysis of vision. The difficulty in this passage
4119 may be explained, like many others, from differences in the modes of
4120 conception prevailing among ancient and modern thinkers. To us, the
4121 perceptions of sense are inseparable from the act of the mind which
4122 accompanies them. The consciousness of form, colour, distance, is
4123 indistinguishable from the simple sensation, which is the medium of
4124 them. Whereas to Plato sense is the Heraclitean flux of sense, not the
4125 vision of objects in the order in which they actually present themselves
4126 to the experienced sight, but as they may be imagined to appear confused
4127 and blurred to the half-awakened eye of the infant. The first action of
4128 the mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this chaos, and
4129 the reason is required to frame distinct conceptions under which
4130 the confused impressions of sense may be arranged. Hence arises
4131 the question, 'What is great, what is small?' and thus begins the
4132 distinction of the visible and the intelligible.
4133 
4134 The second difficulty relates to Plato's conception of harmonics.
4135 Three classes of harmonists are distinguished by him:--first, the
4136 Pythagoreans, whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion
4137 on music he was to consult Damon--they are acknowledged to be masters
4138 in the art, but are altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher
4139 import and relation to the good; secondly, the mere empirics, whom
4140 Glaucon appears to confuse with them, and whom both he and Socrates
4141 ludicrously describe as experimenting by mere auscultation on the
4142 intervals of sounds. Both of these fall short in different degrees of
4143 the Platonic idea of harmony, which must be studied in a purely
4144 abstract way, first by the method of problems, and secondly as a part of
4145 universal knowledge in relation to the idea of good.
4146 
4147 The allegory has a political as well as a philosophical meaning. The
4148 den or cave represents the narrow sphere of politics or law (compare the
4149 description of the philosopher and lawyer in the Theaetetus), and
4150 the light of the eternal ideas is supposed to exercise a disturbing
4151 influence on the minds of those who return to this lower world. In other
4152 words, their principles are too wide for practical application; they are
4153 looking far away into the past and future, when their business is with
4154 the present. The ideal is not easily reduced to the conditions of actual
4155 life, and may often be at variance with them. And at first, those who
4156 return are unable to compete with the inhabitants of the den in the
4157 measurement of the shadows, and are derided and persecuted by them; but
4158 after a while they see the things below in far truer proportions than
4159 those who have never ascended into the upper world. The difference
4160 between the politician turned into a philosopher and the philosopher
4161 turned into a politician, is symbolized by the two kinds of disordered
4162 eyesight, the one which is experienced by the captive who is transferred
4163 from darkness to day, the other, of the heavenly messenger who
4164 voluntarily for the good of his fellow-men descends into the den. In
4165 what way the brighter light is to dawn on the inhabitants of the lower
4166 world, or how the idea of good is to become the guiding principle of
4167 politics, is left unexplained by Plato. Like the nature and divisions of
4168 dialectic, of which Glaucon impatiently demands to be informed, perhaps
4169 he would have said that the explanation could not be given except to a
4170 disciple of the previous sciences. (Symposium.)
4171 
4172 Many illustrations of this part of the Republic may be found in modern
4173 Politics and in daily life. For among ourselves, too, there have
4174 been two sorts of Politicians or Statesmen, whose eyesight has become
4175 disordered in two different ways. First, there have been great men who,
4176 in the language of Burke, 'have been too much given to general
4177 maxims,' who, like J.S. Mill or Burke himself, have been theorists or
4178 philosophers before they were politicians, or who, having been students
4179 of history, have allowed some great historical parallel, such as the
4180 English Revolution of 1688, or possibly Athenian democracy or Roman
4181 Imperialism, to be the medium through which they viewed contemporary
4182 events. Or perhaps the long projecting shadow of some existing
4183 institution may have darkened their vision. The Church of the future,
4184 the Commonwealth of the future, the Society of the future, have
4185 so absorbed their minds, that they are unable to see in their true
4186 proportions the Politics of to-day. They have been intoxicated with
4187 great ideas, such as liberty, or equality, or the greatest happiness of
4188 the greatest number, or the brotherhood of humanity, and they no
4189 longer care to consider how these ideas must be limited in practice or
4190 harmonized with the conditions of human life. They are full of light,
4191 but the light to them has become only a sort of luminous mist or
4192 blindness. Almost every one has known some enthusiastic half-educated
4193 person, who sees everything at false distances, and in erroneous
4194 proportions.
4195 
4196 With this disorder of eyesight may be contrasted another--of those who
4197 see not far into the distance, but what is near only; who have been
4198 engaged all their lives in a trade or a profession; who are limited to
4199 a set or sect of their own. Men of this kind have no universal except
4200 their own interests or the interests of their class, no principle but
4201 the opinion of persons like themselves, no knowledge of affairs beyond
4202 what they pick up in the streets or at their club. Suppose them to be
4203 sent into a larger world, to undertake some higher calling, from being
4204 tradesmen to turn generals or politicians, from being schoolmasters to
4205 become philosophers:--or imagine them on a sudden to receive an inward
4206 light which reveals to them for the first time in their lives a higher
4207 idea of God and the existence of a spiritual world, by this sudden
4208 conversion or change is not their daily life likely to be upset; and on
4209 the other hand will not many of their old prejudices and narrownesses
4210 still adhere to them long after they have begun to take a more
4211 comprehensive view of human things? From familiar examples like these we
4212 may learn what Plato meant by the eyesight which is liable to two kinds
4213 of disorders.
4214 
4215 Nor have we any difficulty in drawing a parallel between the young
4216 Athenian in the fifth century before Christ who became unsettled by new
4217 ideas, and the student of a modern University who has been the subject
4218 of a similar 'aufklarung.' We too observe that when young men begin to
4219 criticise customary beliefs, or to analyse the constitution of human
4220 nature, they are apt to lose hold of solid principle (Greek). They are
4221 like trees which have been frequently transplanted. The earth about them
4222 is loose, and they have no roots reaching far into the soil. They 'light
4223 upon every flower,' following their own wayward wills, or because the
4224 wind blows them. They catch opinions, as diseases are caught--when
4225 they are in the air. Borne hither and thither, 'they speedily fall
4226 into beliefs' the opposite of those in which they were brought up. They
4227 hardly retain the distinction of right and wrong; they seem to think one
4228 thing as good as another. They suppose themselves to be searching after
4229 truth when they are playing the game of 'follow my leader.' They fall
4230 in love 'at first sight' with paradoxes respecting morality, some fancy
4231 about art, some novelty or eccentricity in religion, and like lovers
4232 they are so absorbed for a time in their new notion that they can think
4233 of nothing else. The resolution of some philosophical or theological
4234 question seems to them more interesting and important than any
4235 substantial knowledge of literature or science or even than a good life.
4236 Like the youth in the Philebus, they are ready to discourse to any one
4237 about a new philosophy. They are generally the disciples of some eminent
4238 professor or sophist, whom they rather imitate than understand. They may
4239 be counted happy if in later years they retain some of the simple truths
4240 which they acquired in early education, and which they may, perhaps,
4241 find to be worth all the rest. Such is the picture which Plato draws and
4242 which we only reproduce, partly in his own words, of the dangers which
4243 beset youth in times of transition, when old opinions are fading
4244 away and the new are not yet firmly established. Their condition is
4245 ingeniously compared by him to that of a supposititious son, who has
4246 made the discovery that his reputed parents are not his real ones, and,
4247 in consequence, they have lost their authority over him.
4248 
4249 The distinction between the mathematician and the dialectician is
4250 also noticeable. Plato is very well aware that the faculty of the
4251 mathematician is quite distinct from the higher philosophical sense
4252 which recognizes and combines first principles. The contempt which
4253 he expresses for distinctions of words, the danger of involuntary
4254 falsehood, the apology which Socrates makes for his earnestness of
4255 speech, are highly characteristic of the Platonic style and mode of
4256 thought. The quaint notion that if Palamedes was the inventor of number
4257 Agamemnon could not have counted his feet; the art by which we are made
4258 to believe that this State of ours is not a dream only; the gravity
4259 with which the first step is taken in the actual creation of the State,
4260 namely, the sending out of the city all who had arrived at ten years of
4261 age, in order to expedite the business of education by a generation, are
4262 also truly Platonic. (For the last, compare the passage at the end of
4263 the third book, in which he expects the lie about the earthborn men to
4264 be believed in the second generation.)
4265 
4266 BOOK VIII. And so we have arrived at the conclusion, that in the perfect
4267 State wives and children are to be in common; and the education and
4268 pursuits of men and women, both in war and peace, are to be common, and
4269 kings are to be philosophers and warriors, and the soldiers of the State
4270 are to live together, having all things in common; and they are to be
4271 warrior athletes, receiving no pay but only their food, from the other
4272 citizens. Now let us return to the point at which we digressed. 'That is
4273 easily done,' he replied: 'You were speaking of the State which you had
4274 constructed, and of the individual who answered to this, both of whom
4275 you affirmed to be good; and you said that of inferior States there were
4276 four forms and four individuals corresponding to them, which although
4277 deficient in various degrees, were all of them worth inspecting with
4278 a view to determining the relative happiness or misery of the best or
4279 worst man. Then Polemarchus and Adeimantus interrupted you, and this led
4280 to another argument,--and so here we are.' Suppose that we put ourselves
4281 again in the same position, and do you repeat your question. 'I should
4282 like to know of what constitutions you were speaking?' Besides the
4283 perfect State there are only four of any note in Hellas:--first, the
4284 famous Lacedaemonian or Cretan commonwealth; secondly, oligarchy, a
4285 State full of evils; thirdly, democracy, which follows next in order;
4286 fourthly, tyranny, which is the disease or death of all government.
4287 Now, States are not made of 'oak and rock,' but of flesh and blood; and
4288 therefore as there are five States there must be five human natures in
4289 individuals, which correspond to them. And first, there is the ambitious
4290 nature, which answers to the Lacedaemonian State; secondly, the
4291 oligarchical nature; thirdly, the democratical; and fourthly, the
4292 tyrannical. This last will have to be compared with the perfectly just,
4293 which is the fifth, that we may know which is the happier, and then we
4294 shall be able to determine whether the argument of Thrasymachus or our
4295 own is the more convincing. And as before we began with the State and
4296 went on to the individual, so now, beginning with timocracy, let us
4297 go on to the timocratical man, and then proceed to the other forms of
4298 government, and the individuals who answer to them.
4299 
4300 But how did timocracy arise out of the perfect State? Plainly, like
4301 all changes of government, from division in the rulers. But whence came
4302 division? 'Sing, heavenly Muses,' as Homer says;--let them condescend to
4303 answer us, as if we were children, to whom they put on a solemn face
4304 in jest. 'And what will they say?' They will say that human things are
4305 fated to decay, and even the perfect State will not escape from this
4306 law of destiny, when 'the wheel comes full circle' in a period short or
4307 long. Plants or animals have times of fertility and sterility, which the
4308 intelligence of rulers because alloyed by sense will not enable them to
4309 ascertain, and children will be born out of season. For whereas divine
4310 creations are in a perfect cycle or number, the human creation is in
4311 a number which declines from perfection, and has four terms and three
4312 intervals of numbers, increasing, waning, assimilating, dissimilating,
4313 and yet perfectly commensurate with each other. The base of the number
4314 with a fourth added (or which is 3:4), multiplied by five and cubed,
4315 gives two harmonies:--the first a square number, which is a hundred
4316 times the base (or a hundred times a hundred); the second, an oblong,
4317 being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure the side of
4318 which is five, subtracting one from each square or two perfect squares
4319 from all, and adding a hundred cubes of three. This entire number is
4320 geometrical and contains the rule or law of generation. When this law is
4321 neglected marriages will be unpropitious; the inferior offspring who are
4322 then born will in time become the rulers; the State will decline, and
4323 education fall into decay; gymnastic will be preferred to music, and
4324 the gold and silver and brass and iron will form a chaotic mass--thus
4325 division will arise. Such is the Muses' answer to our question. 'And a
4326 true answer, of course:--but what more have they to say?' They say that
4327 the two races, the iron and brass, and the silver and gold, will draw
4328 the State different ways;--the one will take to trade and moneymaking,
4329 and the others, having the true riches and not caring for money, will
4330 resist them: the contest will end in a compromise; they will agree to
4331 have private property, and will enslave their fellow-citizens who were
4332 once their friends and nurturers. But they will retain their warlike
4333 character, and will be chiefly occupied in fighting and exercising rule.
4334 Thus arises timocracy, which is intermediate between aristocracy and
4335 oligarchy.
4336 
4337 The new form of government resembles the ideal in obedience to rulers
4338 and contempt for trade, and having common meals, and in devotion
4339 to warlike and gymnastic exercises. But corruption has crept into
4340 philosophy, and simplicity of character, which was once her note, is now
4341 looked for only in the military class. Arts of war begin to prevail over
4342 arts of peace; the ruler is no longer a philosopher; as in oligarchies,
4343 there springs up among them an extravagant love of gain--get another
4344 man's and save your own, is their principle; and they have dark places
4345 in which they hoard their gold and silver, for the use of their women
4346 and others; they take their pleasures by stealth, like boys who are
4347 running away from their father--the law; and their education is not
4348 inspired by the Muse, but imposed by the strong arm of power. The
4349 leading characteristic of this State is party spirit and ambition.
4350 
4351 And what manner of man answers to such a State? 'In love of contention,'
4352 replied Adeimantus, 'he will be like our friend Glaucon.' In that
4353 respect, perhaps, but not in others. He is self-asserting and
4354 ill-educated, yet fond of literature, although not himself a
4355 speaker,--fierce with slaves, but obedient to rulers, a lover of power
4356 and honour, which he hopes to gain by deeds of arms,--fond, too, of
4357 gymnastics and of hunting. As he advances in years he grows avaricious,
4358 for he has lost philosophy, which is the only saviour and guardian of
4359 men. His origin is as follows:--His father is a good man dwelling in an
4360 ill-ordered State, who has retired from politics in order that he may
4361 lead a quiet life. His mother is angry at her loss of precedence among
4362 other women; she is disgusted at her husband's selfishness, and she
4363 expatiates to her son on the unmanliness and indolence of his father.
4364 The old family servant takes up the tale, and says to the youth:--'When
4365 you grow up you must be more of a man than your father.' All the world
4366 are agreed that he who minds his own business is an idiot, while a
4367 busybody is highly honoured and esteemed. The young man compares this
4368 spirit with his father's words and ways, and as he is naturally well
4369 disposed, although he has suffered from evil influences, he rests at a
4370 middle point and becomes ambitious and a lover of honour.
4371 
4372 And now let us set another city over against another man. The next form
4373 of government is oligarchy, in which the rule is of the rich only; nor
4374 is it difficult to see how such a State arises. The decline begins with
4375 the possession of gold and silver; illegal modes of expenditure are
4376 invented; one draws another on, and the multitude are infected; riches
4377 outweigh virtue; lovers of money take the place of lovers of honour;
4378 misers of politicians; and, in time, political privileges are confined
4379 by law to the rich, who do not shrink from violence in order to effect
4380 their purposes.
4381 
4382 Thus much of the origin,--let us next consider the evils of oligarchy.
4383 Would a man who wanted to be safe on a voyage take a bad pilot because
4384 he was rich, or refuse a good one because he was poor? And does not the
4385 analogy apply still more to the State? And there are yet greater evils:
4386 two nations are struggling together in one--the rich and the poor; and
4387 the rich dare not put arms into the hands of the poor, and are unwilling
4388 to pay for defenders out of their own money. And have we not already
4389 condemned that State in which the same persons are warriors as well
4390 as shopkeepers? The greatest evil of all is that a man may sell his
4391 property and have no place in the State; while there is one class which
4392 has enormous wealth, the other is entirely destitute. But observe that
4393 these destitutes had not really any more of the governing nature in them
4394 when they were rich than now that they are poor; they were miserable
4395 spendthrifts always. They are the drones of the hive; only whereas the
4396 actual drone is unprovided by nature with a sting, the two-legged things
4397 whom we call drones are some of them without stings and some of them
4398 have dreadful stings; in other words, there are paupers and there are
4399 rogues. These are never far apart; and in oligarchical cities, where
4400 nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler, you will find abundance
4401 of both. And this evil state of society originates in bad education and
4402 bad government.
4403 
4404 Like State, like man,--the change in the latter begins with the
4405 representative of timocracy; he walks at first in the ways of his
4406 father, who may have been a statesman, or general, perhaps; and
4407 presently he sees him 'fallen from his high estate,' the victim of
4408 informers, dying in prison or exile, or by the hand of the executioner.
4409 The lesson which he thus receives, makes him cautious; he leaves
4410 politics, represses his pride, and saves pence. Avarice is enthroned as
4411 his bosom's lord, and assumes the style of the Great King; the rational
4412 and spirited elements sit humbly on the ground at either side, the one
4413 immersed in calculation, the other absorbed in the admiration of
4414 wealth. The love of honour turns to love of money; the conversion
4415 is instantaneous. The man is mean, saving, toiling, the slave of one
4416 passion which is the master of the rest: Is he not the very image of the
4417 State? He has had no education, or he would never have allowed the blind
4418 god of riches to lead the dance within him. And being uneducated he will
4419 have many slavish desires, some beggarly, some knavish, breeding in his
4420 soul. If he is the trustee of an orphan, and has the power to defraud,
4421 he will soon prove that he is not without the will, and that his
4422 passions are only restrained by fear and not by reason. Hence he leads a
4423 divided existence; in which the better desires mostly prevail. But when
4424 he is contending for prizes and other distinctions, he is afraid to
4425 incur a loss which is to be repaid only by barren honour; in time of
4426 war he fights with a small part of his resources, and usually keeps his
4427 money and loses the victory.
4428 
4429 Next comes democracy and the democratic man, out of oligarchy and
4430 the oligarchical man. Insatiable avarice is the ruling passion of an
4431 oligarchy; and they encourage expensive habits in order that they may
4432 gain by the ruin of extravagant youth. Thus men of family often lose
4433 their property or rights of citizenship; but they remain in the city,
4434 full of hatred against the new owners of their estates and ripe for
4435 revolution. The usurer with stooping walk pretends not to see them;
4436 he passes by, and leaves his sting--that is, his money--in some other
4437 victim; and many a man has to pay the parent or principal sum multiplied
4438 into a family of children, and is reduced into a state of dronage by
4439 him. The only way of diminishing the evil is either to limit a man in
4440 his use of his property, or to insist that he shall lend at his own
4441 risk. But the ruling class do not want remedies; they care only for
4442 money, and are as careless of virtue as the poorest of the citizens.
4443 Now there are occasions on which the governors and the governed meet
4444 together,--at festivals, on a journey, voyaging or fighting. The sturdy
4445 pauper finds that in the hour of danger he is not despised; he sees
4446 the rich man puffing and panting, and draws the conclusion which he
4447 privately imparts to his companions,--'that our people are not good for
4448 much;' and as a sickly frame is made ill by a mere touch from without,
4449 or sometimes without external impulse is ready to fall to pieces of
4450 itself, so from the least cause, or with none at all, the city falls ill
4451 and fights a battle for life or death. And democracy comes into power
4452 when the poor are the victors, killing some and exiling some, and giving
4453 equal shares in the government to all the rest.
4454 
4455 The manner of life in such a State is that of democrats; there is
4456 freedom and plainness of speech, and every man does what is right in
4457 his own eyes, and has his own way of life. Hence arise the most various
4458 developments of character; the State is like a piece of embroidery of
4459 which the colours and figures are the manners of men, and there are many
4460 who, like women and children, prefer this variety to real beauty and
4461 excellence. The State is not one but many, like a bazaar at which you
4462 can buy anything. The great charm is, that you may do as you like; you
4463 may govern if you like, let it alone if you like; go to war and make
4464 peace if you feel disposed, and all quite irrespective of anybody
4465 else. When you condemn men to death they remain alive all the same; a
4466 gentleman is desired to go into exile, and he stalks about the streets
4467 like a hero; and nobody sees him or cares for him. Observe, too,
4468 how grandly Democracy sets her foot upon all our fine theories of
4469 education,--how little she cares for the training of her statesmen! The
4470 only qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism.
4471 Such is democracy;--a pleasing, lawless, various sort of government,
4472 distributing equality to equals and unequals alike.
4473 
4474 Let us now inspect the individual democrat; and first, as in the case
4475 of the State, we will trace his antecedents. He is the son of a miserly
4476 oligarch, and has been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessary
4477 pleasures. Perhaps I ought to explain this latter term:--Necessary
4478 pleasures are those which are good, and which we cannot do without;
4479 unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good, and of which the
4480 desire might be eradicated by early training. For example, the pleasures
4481 of eating and drinking are necessary and healthy, up to a certain point;
4482 beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and mind, and the
4483 excess may be avoided. When in excess, they may be rightly called
4484 expensive pleasures, in opposition to the useful ones. And the drone, as
4485 we called him, is the slave of these unnecessary pleasures and desires,
4486 whereas the miserly oligarch is subject only to the necessary.
4487 
4488 The oligarch changes into the democrat in the following manner:--The
4489 youth who has had a miserly bringing up, gets a taste of the drone's
4490 honey; he meets with wild companions, who introduce him to every new
4491 pleasure. As in the State, so in the individual, there are allies on
4492 both sides, temptations from without and passions from within; there is
4493 reason also and external influences of parents and friends in alliance
4494 with the oligarchical principle; and the two factions are in violent
4495 conflict with one another. Sometimes the party of order prevails, but
4496 then again new desires and new disorders arise, and the whole mob of
4497 passions gets possession of the Acropolis, that is to say, the soul,
4498 which they find void and unguarded by true words and works. Falsehoods
4499 and illusions ascend to take their place; the prodigal goes back into
4500 the country of the Lotophagi or drones, and openly dwells there. And if
4501 any offer of alliance or parley of individual elders comes from home,
4502 the false spirits shut the gates of the castle and permit no one to
4503 enter,--there is a battle, and they gain the victory; and straightway
4504 making alliance with the desires, they banish modesty, which they call
4505 folly, and send temperance over the border. When the house has been
4506 swept and garnished, they dress up the exiled vices, and, crowning them
4507 with garlands, bring them back under new names. Insolence they call good
4508 breeding, anarchy freedom, waste magnificence, impudence courage. Such
4509 is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary pleasures to
4510 the unnecessary. After a while he divides his time impartially between
4511 them; and perhaps, when he gets older and the violence of passion
4512 has abated, he restores some of the exiles and lives in a sort of
4513 equilibrium, indulging first one pleasure and then another; and if
4514 reason comes and tells him that some pleasures are good and honourable,
4515 and others bad and vile, he shakes his head and says that he can make
4516 no distinction between them. Thus he lives in the fancy of the hour;
4517 sometimes he takes to drink, and then he turns abstainer; he practises
4518 in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all; then again he would be a
4519 philosopher or a politician; or again, he would be a warrior or a man of
4520 business; he is
4521 
4522    'Every thing by starts and nothing long.'
4523 
4524 There remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all
4525 States--tyranny and the tyrant. Tyranny springs from democracy much as
4526 democracy springs from oligarchy. Both arise from excess; the one from
4527 excess of wealth, the other from excess of freedom. 'The great natural
4528 good of life,' says the democrat, 'is freedom.' And this exclusive love
4529 of freedom and regardlessness of everything else, is the cause of the
4530 change from democracy to tyranny. The State demands the strong wine of
4531 freedom, and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught, punishes
4532 and insults them; equality and fraternity of governors and governed is
4533 the approved principle. Anarchy is the law, not of the State only, but
4534 of private houses, and extends even to the animals. Father and son,
4535 citizen and foreigner, teacher and pupil, old and young, are all on a
4536 level; fathers and teachers fear their sons and pupils, and the wisdom
4537 of the young man is a match for the elder, and the old imitate the
4538 jaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being thought
4539 morose. Slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses, and
4540 there is no difference between men and women. Nay, the very animals in
4541 a democratic State have a freedom which is unknown in other places. The
4542 she-dogs are as good as their she-mistresses, and horses and asses march
4543 along with dignity and run their noses against anybody who comes in
4544 their way. 'That has often been my experience.' At last the citizens
4545 become so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws, written or
4546 unwritten; they would have no man call himself their master. Such is the
4547 glorious beginning of things out of which tyranny springs. 'Glorious,
4548 indeed; but what is to follow?' The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of
4549 democracy; for there is a law of contraries; the excess of freedom
4550 passes into the excess of slavery, and the greater the freedom the
4551 greater the slavery. You will remember that in the oligarchy were found
4552 two classes--rogues and paupers, whom we compared to drones with and
4553 without stings. These two classes are to the State what phlegm and bile
4554 are to the human body; and the State-physician, or legislator, must get
4555 rid of them, just as the bee-master keeps the drones out of the hive.
4556 Now in a democracy, too, there are drones, but they are more numerous
4557 and more dangerous than in the oligarchy; there they are inert and
4558 unpractised, here they are full of life and animation; and the keener
4559 sort speak and act, while the others buzz about the bema and prevent
4560 their opponents from being heard. And there is another class in
4561 democratic States, of respectable, thriving individuals, who can be
4562 squeezed when the drones have need of their possessions; there is
4563 moreover a third class, who are the labourers and the artisans, and
4564 they make up the mass of the people. When the people meet, they
4565 are omnipotent, but they cannot be brought together unless they are
4566 attracted by a little honey; and the rich are made to supply the honey,
4567 of which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves, giving a taste
4568 only to the mob. Their victims attempt to resist; they are driven mad
4569 by the stings of the drones, and so become downright oligarchs in
4570 self-defence. Then follow informations and convictions for treason. The
4571 people have some protector whom they nurse into greatness, and from this
4572 root the tree of tyranny springs. The nature of the change is indicated
4573 in the old fable of the temple of Zeus Lycaeus, which tells how he who
4574 tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims will turn
4575 into a wolf. Even so the protector, who tastes human blood, and slays
4576 some and exiles others with or without law, who hints at abolition of
4577 debts and division of lands, must either perish or become a wolf--that
4578 is, a tyrant. Perhaps he is driven out, but he soon comes back from
4579 exile; and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by lawful means,
4580 they plot his assassination. Thereupon the friend of the people makes
4581 his well-known request to them for a body-guard, which they readily
4582 grant, thinking only of his danger and not of their own. Now let the
4583 rich man make to himself wings, for he will never run away again if he
4584 does not do so then. And the Great Protector, having crushed all his
4585 rivals, stands proudly erect in the chariot of State, a full-blown
4586 tyrant: Let us enquire into the nature of his happiness.
4587 
4588 In the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody; he
4589 is not a 'dominus,' no, not he: he has only come to put an end to debt
4590 and the monopoly of land. Having got rid of foreign enemies, he makes
4591 himself necessary to the State by always going to war. He is thus
4592 enabled to depress the poor by heavy taxes, and so keep them at work;
4593 and he can get rid of bolder spirits by handing them over to the enemy.
4594 Then comes unpopularity; some of his old associates have the courage to
4595 oppose him. The consequence is, that he has to make a purgation of the
4596 State; but, unlike the physician who purges away the bad, he must get
4597 rid of the high-spirited, the wise and the wealthy; for he has no choice
4598 between death and a life of shame and dishonour. And the more hated he
4599 is, the more he will require trusty guards; but how will he obtain them?
4600 'They will come flocking like birds--for pay.' Will he not rather obtain
4601 them on the spot? He will take the slaves from their owners and make
4602 them his body-guard; these are his trusted friends, who admire and
4603 look up to him. Are not the tragic poets wise who magnify and exalt the
4604 tyrant, and say that he is wise by association with the wise? And are
4605 not their praises of tyranny alone a sufficient reason why we should
4606 exclude them from our State? They may go to other cities, and gather the
4607 mob about them with fine words, and change commonwealths into tyrannies
4608 and democracies, receiving honours and rewards for their services; but
4609 the higher they and their friends ascend constitution hill, the more
4610 their honour will fail and become 'too asthmatic to mount.' To return to
4611 the tyrant--How will he support that rare army of his? First, by robbing
4612 the temples of their treasures, which will enable him to lighten the
4613 taxes; then he will take all his father's property, and spend it on
4614 his companions, male or female. Now his father is the demus, and if the
4615 demus gets angry, and says that a great hulking son ought not to be a
4616 burden on his parents, and bids him and his riotous crew begone, then
4617 will the parent know what a monster he has been nurturing, and that the
4618 son whom he would fain expel is too strong for him. 'You do not mean to
4619 say that he will beat his father?' Yes, he will, after having taken away
4620 his arms. 'Then he is a parricide and a cruel, unnatural son.' And the
4621 people have jumped from the fear of slavery into slavery, out of the
4622 smoke into the fire. Thus liberty, when out of all order and reason,
4623 passes into the worst form of servitude...
4624 
4625 In the previous books Plato has described the ideal State; now he
4626 returns to the perverted or declining forms, on which he had lightly
4627 touched at the end of Book IV. These he describes in a succession of
4628 parallels between the individuals and the States, tracing the origin of
4629 either in the State or individual which has preceded them. He begins
4630 by asking the point at which he digressed; and is thus led shortly to
4631 recapitulate the substance of the three former books, which also contain
4632 a parallel of the philosopher and the State.
4633 
4634 Of the first decline he gives no intelligible account; he would not have
4635 liked to admit the most probable causes of the fall of his ideal State,
4636 which to us would appear to be the impracticability of communism or the
4637 natural antagonism of the ruling and subject classes. He throws a
4638 veil of mystery over the origin of the decline, which he attributes to
4639 ignorance of the law of population. Of this law the famous geometrical
4640 figure or number is the expression. Like the ancients in general, he had
4641 no idea of the gradual perfectibility of man or of the education of the
4642 human race. His ideal was not to be attained in the course of ages, but
4643 was to spring in full armour from the head of the legislator. When good
4644 laws had been given, he thought only of the manner in which they were
4645 likely to be corrupted, or of how they might be filled up in detail or
4646 restored in accordance with their original spirit. He appears not to
4647 have reflected upon the full meaning of his own words, 'In the brief
4648 space of human life, nothing great can be accomplished'; or again, as he
4649 afterwards says in the Laws, 'Infinite time is the maker of cities.' The
4650 order of constitutions which is adopted by him represents an order of
4651 thought rather than a succession of time, and may be considered as the
4652 first attempt to frame a philosophy of history.
4653 
4654 The first of these declining States is timocracy, or the government of
4655 soldiers and lovers of honour, which answers to the Spartan State; this
4656 is a government of force, in which education is not inspired by the
4657 Muses, but imposed by the law, and in which all the finer elements of
4658 organization have disappeared. The philosopher himself has lost the
4659 love of truth, and the soldier, who is of a simpler and honester nature,
4660 rules in his stead. The individual who answers to timocracy has some
4661 noticeable qualities. He is described as ill educated, but, like the
4662 Spartan, a lover of literature; and although he is a harsh master to his
4663 servants he has no natural superiority over them. His character is
4664 based upon a reaction against the circumstances of his father, who in
4665 a troubled city has retired from politics; and his mother, who is
4666 dissatisfied at her own position, is always urging him towards the life
4667 of political ambition. Such a character may have had this origin, and
4668 indeed Livy attributes the Licinian laws to a feminine jealousy of a
4669 similar kind. But there is obviously no connection between the manner
4670 in which the timocratic State springs out of the ideal, and the mere
4671 accident by which the timocratic man is the son of a retired statesman.
4672 
4673 The two next stages in the decline of constitutions have even less
4674 historical foundation. For there is no trace in Greek history of a
4675 polity like the Spartan or Cretan passing into an oligarchy of wealth,
4676 or of the oligarchy of wealth passing into a democracy. The order of
4677 history appears to be different; first, in the Homeric times there is
4678 the royal or patriarchal form of government, which a century or two
4679 later was succeeded by an oligarchy of birth rather than of wealth, and
4680 in which wealth was only the accident of the hereditary possession of
4681 land and power. Sometimes this oligarchical government gave way to a
4682 government based upon a qualification of property, which, according to
4683 Aristotle's mode of using words, would have been called a timocracy;
4684 and this in some cities, as at Athens, became the conducting medium to
4685 democracy. But such was not the necessary order of succession in States;
4686 nor, indeed, can any order be discerned in the endless fluctuation of
4687 Greek history (like the tides in the Euripus), except, perhaps, in the
4688 almost uniform tendency from monarchy to aristocracy in the earliest
4689 times. At first sight there appears to be a similar inversion in the
4690 last step of the Platonic succession; for tyranny, instead of being the
4691 natural end of democracy, in early Greek history appears rather as a
4692 stage leading to democracy; the reign of Peisistratus and his sons is
4693 an episode which comes between the legislation of Solon and the
4694 constitution of Cleisthenes; and some secret cause common to them all
4695 seems to have led the greater part of Hellas at her first appearance
4696 in the dawn of history, e.g. Athens, Argos, Corinth, Sicyon, and nearly
4697 every State with the exception of Sparta, through a similar stage of
4698 tyranny which ended either in oligarchy or democracy. But then we must
4699 remember that Plato is describing rather the contemporary governments
4700 of the Sicilian States, which alternated between democracy and tyranny,
4701 than the ancient history of Athens or Corinth.
4702 
4703 The portrait of the tyrant himself is just such as the later Greek
4704 delighted to draw of Phalaris and Dionysius, in which, as in the lives
4705 of mediaeval saints or mythic heroes, the conduct and actions of one
4706 were attributed to another in order to fill up the outline. There was
4707 no enormity which the Greek was not today to believe of them; the tyrant
4708 was the negation of government and law; his assassination was glorious;
4709 there was no crime, however unnatural, which might not with probability
4710 be attributed to him. In this, Plato was only following the common
4711 thought of his countrymen, which he embellished and exaggerated with all
4712 the power of his genius. There is no need to suppose that he drew
4713 from life; or that his knowledge of tyrants is derived from a personal
4714 acquaintance with Dionysius. The manner in which he speaks of them would
4715 rather tend to render doubtful his ever having 'consorted' with them, or
4716 entertained the schemes, which are attributed to him in the Epistles, of
4717 regenerating Sicily by their help.
4718 
4719 Plato in a hyperbolical and serio-comic vein exaggerates the follies of
4720 democracy which he also sees reflected in social life. To him democracy
4721 is a state of individualism or dissolution; in which every one is doing
4722 what is right in his own eyes. Of a people animated by a common spirit
4723 of liberty, rising as one man to repel the Persian host, which is the
4724 leading idea of democracy in Herodotus and Thucydides, he never seems to
4725 think. But if he is not a believer in liberty, still less is he a lover
4726 of tyranny. His deeper and more serious condemnation is reserved for the
4727 tyrant, who is the ideal of wickedness and also of weakness, and who
4728 in his utter helplessness and suspiciousness is leading an almost
4729 impossible existence, without that remnant of good which, in Plato's
4730 opinion, was required to give power to evil (Book I). This ideal of
4731 wickedness living in helpless misery, is the reverse of that other
4732 portrait of perfect injustice ruling in happiness and splendour, which
4733 first of all Thrasymachus, and afterwards the sons of Ariston had drawn,
4734 and is also the reverse of the king whose rule of life is the good of
4735 his subjects.
4736 
4737 Each of these governments and individuals has a corresponding
4738 ethical gradation: the ideal State is under the rule of reason, not
4739 extinguishing but harmonizing the passions, and training them in virtue;
4740 in the timocracy and the timocratic man the constitution, whether of the
4741 State or of the individual, is based, first, upon courage, and secondly,
4742 upon the love of honour; this latter virtue, which is hardly to be
4743 esteemed a virtue, has superseded all the rest. In the second stage of
4744 decline the virtues have altogether disappeared, and the love of gain
4745 has succeeded to them; in the third stage, or democracy, the various
4746 passions are allowed to have free play, and the virtues and vices are
4747 impartially cultivated. But this freedom, which leads to many curious
4748 extravagances of character, is in reality only a state of weakness and
4749 dissipation. At last, one monster passion takes possession of the whole
4750 nature of man--this is tyranny. In all of them excess--the excess first
4751 of wealth and then of freedom, is the element of decay.
4752 
4753 The eighth book of the Republic abounds in pictures of life and fanciful
4754 allusions; the use of metaphorical language is carried to a greater
4755 extent than anywhere else in Plato. We may remark,
4756 
4757 (1), the description of the two nations in one, which become more and
4758 more divided in the Greek Republics, as in feudal times, and perhaps
4759 also in our own;
4760 
4761 (2), the notion of democracy expressed in a sort of Pythagorean formula
4762 as equality among unequals;
4763 
4764 (3), the free and easy ways of men and animals, which are characteristic
4765 of liberty, as foreign mercenaries and universal mistrust are of the
4766 tyrant;
4767 
4768 (4), the proposal that mere debts should not be recoverable by law is a
4769 speculation which has often been entertained by reformers of the law
4770 in modern times, and is in harmony with the tendencies of modern
4771 legislation. Debt and land were the two great difficulties of the
4772 ancient lawgiver: in modern times we may be said to have almost, if not
4773 quite, solved the first of these difficulties, but hardly the second.
4774 
4775 Still more remarkable are the corresponding portraits of individuals:
4776 there is the family picture of the father and mother and the old servant
4777 of the timocratical man, and the outward respectability and inherent
4778 meanness of the oligarchical; the uncontrolled licence and freedom of
4779 the democrat, in which the young Alcibiades seems to be depicted, doing
4780 right or wrong as he pleases, and who at last, like the prodigal,
4781 goes into a far country (note here the play of language by which the
4782 democratic man is himself represented under the image of a State having
4783 a citadel and receiving embassies); and there is the wild-beast nature,
4784 which breaks loose in his successor. The hit about the tyrant being a
4785 parricide; the representation of the tyrant's life as an obscene dream;
4786 the rhetorical surprise of a more miserable than the most miserable of
4787 men in Book IX; the hint to the poets that if they are the friends of
4788 tyrants there is no place for them in a constitutional State, and that
4789 they are too clever not to see the propriety of their own expulsion; the
4790 continuous image of the drones who are of two kinds, swelling at last
4791 into the monster drone having wings (Book IX),--are among Plato's
4792 happiest touches.
4793 
4794 There remains to be considered the great difficulty of this book of the
4795 Republic, the so-called number of the State. This is a puzzle almost as
4796 great as the Number of the Beast in the Book of Revelation, and though
4797 apparently known to Aristotle, is referred to by Cicero as a proverb of
4798 obscurity (Ep. ad Att.). And some have imagined that there is no answer
4799 to the puzzle, and that Plato has been practising upon his readers.
4800 But such a deception as this is inconsistent with the manner in which
4801 Aristotle speaks of the number (Pol.), and would have been ridiculous to
4802 any reader of the Republic who was acquainted with Greek mathematics.
4803 As little reason is there for supposing that Plato intentionally used
4804 obscure expressions; the obscurity arises from our want of familiarity
4805 with the subject. On the other hand, Plato himself indicates that he is
4806 not altogether serious, and in describing his number as a solemn jest of
4807 the Muses, he appears to imply some degree of satire on the symbolical
4808 use of number. (Compare Cratylus; Protag.)
4809 
4810 Our hope of understanding the passage depends principally on an accurate
4811 study of the words themselves; on which a faint light is thrown by the
4812 parallel passage in the ninth book. Another help is the allusion in
4813 Aristotle, who makes the important remark that the latter part of the
4814 passage (Greek) describes a solid figure. (Pol.--'He only says that
4815 nothing is abiding, but that all things change in a certain cycle; and
4816 that the origin of the change is a base of numbers which are in the
4817 ratio of 4:3; and this when combined with a figure of five gives two
4818 harmonies; he means when the number of this figure becomes solid.')
4819 Some further clue may be gathered from the appearance of the Pythagorean
4820 triangle, which is denoted by the numbers 3, 4, 5, and in which, as in
4821 every right-angled triangle, the squares of the two lesser sides equal
4822 the square of the hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25).
4823 
4824 Plato begins by speaking of a perfect or cyclical number (Tim.), i.e.
4825 a number in which the sum of the divisors equals the whole; this is the
4826 divine or perfect number in which all lesser cycles or revolutions are
4827 complete. He also speaks of a human or imperfect number, having four
4828 terms and three intervals of numbers which are related to one another in
4829 certain proportions; these he converts into figures, and finds in
4830 them when they have been raised to the third power certain elements of
4831 number, which give two 'harmonies,' the one square, the other oblong;
4832 but he does not say that the square number answers to the divine, or the
4833 oblong number to the human cycle; nor is any intimation given that the
4834 first or divine number represents the period of the world, the second
4835 the period of the state, or of the human race as Zeller supposes; nor
4836 is the divine number afterwards mentioned (Arist.). The second is the
4837 number of generations or births, and presides over them in the same
4838 mysterious manner in which the stars preside over them, or in which,
4839 according to the Pythagoreans, opportunity, justice, marriage, are
4840 represented by some number or figure. This is probably the number 216.
4841 
4842 The explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up
4843 the number 8000. This explanation derives a certain plausibility from
4844 the circumstance that 8000 is the ancient number of the Spartan citizens
4845 (Herod.), and would be what Plato might have called 'a number which
4846 nearly concerns the population of a city'; the mysterious disappearance
4847 of the Spartan population may possibly have suggested to him the first
4848 cause of his decline of States. The lesser or square 'harmony,' of 400,
4849 might be a symbol of the guardians,--the larger or oblong 'harmony,'
4850 of the people, and the numbers 3, 4, 5 might refer respectively to the
4851 three orders in the State or parts of the soul, the four virtues, the
4852 five forms of government. The harmony of the musical scale, which
4853 is elsewhere used as a symbol of the harmony of the state, is also
4854 indicated. For the numbers 3, 4, 5, which represent the sides of the
4855 Pythagorean triangle, also denote the intervals of the scale.
4856 
4857 The terms used in the statement of the problem may be explained as
4858 follows. A perfect number (Greek), as already stated, is one which is
4859 equal to the sum of its divisors. Thus 6, which is the first perfect or
4860 cyclical number, = 1 + 2 + 3. The words (Greek), 'terms' or 'notes,' and
4861 (Greek), 'intervals,' are applicable to music as well as to number and
4862 figure. (Greek) is the 'base' on which the whole calculation depends,
4863 or the 'lowest term' from which it can be worked out. The words (Greek)
4864 have been variously translated--'squared and cubed' (Donaldson),
4865 'equalling and equalled in power' (Weber), 'by involution and
4866 evolution,' i.e. by raising the power and extracting the root (as in
4867 the translation). Numbers are called 'like and unlike' (Greek) when the
4868 factors or the sides of the planes and cubes which they represent are
4869 or are not in the same ratio: e.g. 8 and 27 = 2 cubed and 3 cubed; and
4870 conversely. 'Waxing' (Greek) numbers, called also 'increasing' (Greek),
4871 are those which are exceeded by the sum of their divisors: e.g. 12
4872 and 18 are less than 16 and 21. 'Waning' (Greek) numbers, called also
4873 'decreasing' (Greek) are those which succeed the sum of their divisors:
4874 e.g. 8 and 27 exceed 7 and 13. The words translated 'commensurable
4875 and agreeable to one another' (Greek) seem to be different ways of
4876 describing the same relation, with more or less precision. They are
4877 equivalent to 'expressible in terms having the same relation to one
4878 another,' like the series 8, 12, 18, 27, each of which numbers is in the
4879 relation of (1 and 1/2) to the preceding. The 'base,' or 'fundamental
4880 number, which has 1/3 added to it' (1 and 1/3) = 4/3 or a musical
4881 fourth. (Greek) is a 'proportion' of numbers as of musical notes,
4882 applied either to the parts or factors of a single number or to the
4883 relation of one number to another. The first harmony is a 'square'
4884 number (Greek); the second harmony is an 'oblong' number (Greek), i.e. a
4885 number representing a figure of which the opposite sides only are
4886 equal. (Greek) = 'numbers squared from' or 'upon diameters'; (Greek)
4887 = 'rational,' i.e. omitting fractions, (Greek), 'irrational,' i.e.
4888 including fractions; e.g. 49 is a square of the rational diameter of a
4889 figure the side of which = 5: 50, of an irrational diameter of the same.
4890 For several of the explanations here given and for a good deal besides
4891 I am indebted to an excellent article on the Platonic Number by Dr.
4892 Donaldson (Proc. of the Philol. Society).
4893 
4894 The conclusions which he draws from these data are summed up by him as
4895 follows. Having assumed that the number of the perfect or divine cycle
4896 is the number of the world, and the number of the imperfect cycle the
4897 number of the state, he proceeds: 'The period of the world is defined
4898 by the perfect number 6, that of the state by the cube of that number
4899 or 216, which is the product of the last pair of terms in the Platonic
4900 Tetractys (a series of seven terms, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27); and if
4901 we take this as the basis of our computation, we shall have two cube
4902 numbers (Greek), viz. 8 and 27; and the mean proportionals between
4903 these, viz. 12 and 18, will furnish three intervals and four terms,
4904 and these terms and intervals stand related to one another in the
4905 sesqui-altera ratio, i.e. each term is to the preceding as 3/2. Now if
4906 we remember that the number 216 = 8 x 27 = 3 cubed + 4 cubed + 5 cubed,
4907 and 3 squared + 4 squared = 5 squared, we must admit that this
4908 number implies the numbers 3, 4, 5, to which musicians attach so much
4909 importance. And if we combine the ratio 4/3 with the number 5, or
4910 multiply the ratios of the sides by the hypotenuse, we shall by first
4911 squaring and then cubing obtain two expressions, which denote the ratio
4912 of the two last pairs of terms in the Platonic Tetractys, the former
4913 multiplied by the square, the latter by the cube of the number 10, the
4914 sum of the first four digits which constitute the Platonic Tetractys.'
4915 The two (Greek) he elsewhere explains as follows: 'The first (Greek) is
4916 (Greek), in other words (4/3 x 5) all squared = 100 x 2 squared over 3
4917 squared. The second (Greek), a cube of the same root, is described
4918 as 100 multiplied (alpha) by the rational diameter of 5 diminished
4919 by unity, i.e., as shown above, 48: (beta) by two incommensurable
4920 diameters, i.e. the two first irrationals, or 2 and 3: and (gamma) by
4921 the cube of 3, or 27. Thus we have (48 + 5 + 27) 100 = 1000 x 2 cubed.
4922 This second harmony is to be the cube of the number of which the former
4923 harmony is the square, and therefore must be divided by the cube of
4924 3. In other words, the whole expression will be: (1), for the first
4925 harmony, 400/9: (2), for the second harmony, 8000/27.'
4926 
4927 The reasons which have inclined me to agree with Dr. Donaldson and also
4928 with Schleiermacher in supposing that 216 is the Platonic number of
4929 births are: (1) that it coincides with the description of the number
4930 given in the first part of the passage (Greek...): (2) that the
4931 number 216 with its permutations would have been familiar to a Greek
4932 mathematician, though unfamiliar to us: (3) that 216 is the cube of
4933 6, and also the sum of 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed, the numbers 3, 4, 5
4934 representing the Pythagorean triangle, of which the sides when squared
4935 equal the square of the hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25): (4) that it is also
4936 the period of the Pythagorean Metempsychosis: (5) the three ultimate
4937 terms or bases (3, 4, 5) of which 216 is composed answer to the third,
4938 fourth, fifth in the musical scale: (6) that the number 216 is the
4939 product of the cubes of 2 and 3, which are the two last terms in
4940 the Platonic Tetractys: (7) that the Pythagorean triangle is said by
4941 Plutarch (de Is. et Osir.), Proclus (super prima Eucl.), and Quintilian
4942 (de Musica) to be contained in this passage, so that the tradition
4943 of the school seems to point in the same direction: (8) that the
4944 Pythagorean triangle is called also the figure of marriage (Greek).
4945 
4946 But though agreeing with Dr. Donaldson thus far, I see no reason for
4947 supposing, as he does, that the first or perfect number is the world,
4948 the human or imperfect number the state; nor has he given any proof that
4949 the second harmony is a cube. Nor do I think that (Greek) can mean
4950 'two incommensurables,' which he arbitrarily assumes to be 2 and 3,
4951 but rather, as the preceding clause implies, (Greek), i.e. two square
4952 numbers based upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which is
4953 5 = 50 x 2.
4954 
4955 The greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the
4956 words (Greek), 'a base of three with a third added to it, multiplied
4957 by 5.' In this somewhat forced manner Plato introduces once more the
4958 numbers of the Pythagorean triangle. But the coincidences in the numbers
4959 which follow are in favour of the explanation. The first harmony of 400,
4960 as has been already remarked, probably represents the rulers; the second
4961 and oblong harmony of 7600, the people.
4962 
4963 And here we take leave of the difficulty. The discovery of the riddle
4964 would be useless, and would throw no light on ancient mathematics. The
4965 point of interest is that Plato should have used such a symbol, and
4966 that so much of the Pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him. His
4967 general meaning is that divine creation is perfect, and is represented
4968 or presided over by a perfect or cyclical number; human generation is
4969 imperfect, and represented or presided over by an imperfect number or
4970 series of numbers. The number 5040, which is the number of the citizens
4971 in the Laws, is expressly based by him on utilitarian grounds, namely,
4972 the convenience of the number for division; it is also made up of
4973 the first seven digits multiplied by one another. The contrast of the
4974 perfect and imperfect number may have been easily suggested by the
4975 corrections of the cycle, which were made first by Meton and secondly
4976 by Callippus; (the latter is said to have been a pupil of Plato). Of the
4977 degree of importance or of exactness to be attributed to the problem,
4978 the number of the tyrant in Book IX (729 = 365 x 2), and the slight
4979 correction of the error in the number 5040/12 (Laws), may furnish a
4980 criterion. There is nothing surprising in the circumstance that those
4981 who were seeking for order in nature and had found order in number,
4982 should have imagined one to give law to the other. Plato believes in
4983 a power of number far beyond what he could see realized in the world
4984 around him, and he knows the great influence which 'the little matter
4985 of 1, 2, 3' exercises upon education. He may even be thought to have a
4986 prophetic anticipation of the discoveries of Quetelet and others, that
4987 numbers depend upon numbers; e.g.--in population, the numbers of births
4988 and the respective numbers of children born of either sex, on the
4989 respective ages of parents, i.e. on other numbers.
4990 
4991 BOOK IX. Last of all comes the tyrannical man, about whom we have to
4992 enquire, Whence is he, and how does he live--in happiness or in misery?
4993 There is, however, a previous question of the nature and number of
4994 the appetites, which I should like to consider first. Some of them
4995 are unlawful, and yet admit of being chastened and weakened in various
4996 degrees by the power of reason and law. 'What appetites do you mean?' I
4997 mean those which are awake when the reasoning powers are asleep, which
4998 get up and walk about naked without any self-respect or shame; and there
4999 is no conceivable folly or crime, however cruel or unnatural, of which,
5000 in imagination, they may not be guilty. 'True,' he said; 'very true.'
5001 But when a man's pulse beats temperately; and he has supped on a feast
5002 of reason and come to a knowledge of himself before going to rest, and
5003 has satisfied his desires just enough to prevent their perturbing his
5004 reason, which remains clear and luminous, and when he is free from
5005 quarrel and heat,--the visions which he has on his bed are least
5006 irregular and abnormal. Even in good men there is such an irregular
5007 wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep.
5008 
5009 To return:--You remember what was said of the democrat; that he was the
5010 son of a miserly father, who encouraged the saving desires and repressed
5011 the ornamental and expensive ones; presently the youth got into fine
5012 company, and began to entertain a dislike to his father's narrow ways;
5013 and being a better man than the corrupters of his youth, he came to a
5014 mean, and led a life, not of lawless or slavish passion, but of regular
5015 and successive indulgence. Now imagine that the youth has become a
5016 father, and has a son who is exposed to the same temptations, and has
5017 companions who lead him into every sort of iniquity, and parents and
5018 friends who try to keep him right. The counsellors of evil find that
5019 their only chance of retaining him is to implant in his soul a monster
5020 drone, or love; while other desires buzz around him and mystify him with
5021 sweet sounds and scents, this monster love takes possession of him,
5022 and puts an end to every true or modest thought or wish. Love, like
5023 drunkenness and madness, is a tyranny; and the tyrannical man, whether
5024 made by nature or habit, is just a drinking, lusting, furious sort of
5025 animal.
5026 
5027 And how does such an one live? 'Nay, that you must tell me.' Well then,
5028 I fancy that he will live amid revelries and harlotries, and love will
5029 be the lord and master of the house. Many desires require much money,
5030 and so he spends all that he has and borrows more; and when he has
5031 nothing the young ravens are still in the nest in which they were
5032 hatched, crying for food. Love urges them on; and they must be gratified
5033 by force or fraud, or if not, they become painful and troublesome;
5034 and as the new pleasures succeed the old ones, so will the son take
5035 possession of the goods of his parents; if they show signs of refusing,
5036 he will defraud and deceive them; and if they openly resist, what then?
5037 'I can only say, that I should not much like to be in their place.'
5038 But, O heavens, Adeimantus, to think that for some new-fangled and
5039 unnecessary love he will give up his old father and mother, best and
5040 dearest of friends, or enslave them to the fancies of the hour! Truly a
5041 tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother! When there is no
5042 more to be got out of them, he turns burglar or pickpocket, or robs a
5043 temple. Love overmasters the thoughts of his youth, and he becomes
5044 in sober reality the monster that he was sometimes in sleep. He waxes
5045 strong in all violence and lawlessness; and is ready for any deed of
5046 daring that will supply the wants of his rabble-rout. In a well-ordered
5047 State there are only a few such, and these in time of war go out and
5048 become the mercenaries of a tyrant. But in time of peace they stay
5049 at home and do mischief; they are the thieves, footpads, cut-purses,
5050 man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to speak, they turn
5051 false-witnesses and informers. 'No small catalogue of crimes truly,
5052 even if the perpetrators are few.' Yes, I said; but small and great are
5053 relative terms, and no crimes which are committed by them approach those
5054 of the tyrant, whom this class, growing strong and numerous, create out
5055 of themselves. If the people yield, well and good, but, if they resist,
5056 then, as before he beat his father and mother, so now he beats his
5057 fatherland and motherland, and places his mercenaries over them. Such
5058 men in their early days live with flatterers, and they themselves
5059 flatter others, in order to gain their ends; but they soon discard their
5060 followers when they have no longer any need of them; they are always
5061 either masters or servants,--the joys of friendship are unknown to them.
5062 And they are utterly treacherous and unjust, if the nature of justice be
5063 at all understood by us. They realize our dream; and he who is the most
5064 of a tyrant by nature, and leads the life of a tyrant for the longest
5065 time, will be the worst of them, and being the worst of them, will also
5066 be the most miserable.
5067 
5068 Like man, like State,--the tyrannical man will answer to tyranny, which
5069 is the extreme opposite of the royal State; for one is the best and the
5070 other the worst. But which is the happier? Great and terrible as the
5071 tyrant may appear enthroned amid his satellites, let us not be afraid to
5072 go in and ask; and the answer is, that the monarchical is the happiest,
5073 and the tyrannical the most miserable of States. And may we not ask the
5074 same question about the men themselves, requesting some one to look into
5075 them who is able to penetrate the inner nature of man, and will not be
5076 panic-struck by the vain pomp of tyranny? I will suppose that he is one
5077 who has lived with him, and has seen him in family life, or perhaps in
5078 the hour of trouble and danger.
5079 
5080 Assuming that we ourselves are the impartial judge for whom we seek, let
5081 us begin by comparing the individual and State, and ask first of all,
5082 whether the State is likely to be free or enslaved--Will there not be
5083 a little freedom and a great deal of slavery? And the freedom is of the
5084 bad, and the slavery of the good; and this applies to the man as well
5085 as to the State; for his soul is full of meanness and slavery, and the
5086 better part is enslaved to the worse. He cannot do what he would, and
5087 his mind is full of confusion; he is the very reverse of a freeman. The
5088 State will be poor and full of misery and sorrow; and the man's soul
5089 will also be poor and full of sorrows, and he will be the most miserable
5090 of men. No, not the most miserable, for there is yet a more miserable.
5091 'Who is that?' The tyrannical man who has the misfortune also to become
5092 a public tyrant. 'There I suspect that you are right.' Say rather, 'I
5093 am sure;' conjecture is out of place in an enquiry of this nature. He
5094 is like a wealthy owner of slaves, only he has more of them than
5095 any private individual. You will say, 'The owners of slaves are not
5096 generally in any fear of them.' But why? Because the whole city is in a
5097 league which protects the individual. Suppose however that one of these
5098 owners and his household is carried off by a god into a wilderness,
5099 where there are no freemen to help him--will he not be in an agony of
5100 terror?--will he not be compelled to flatter his slaves and to promise
5101 them many things sore against his will? And suppose the same god who
5102 carried him off were to surround him with neighbours who declare that no
5103 man ought to have slaves, and that the owners of them should be punished
5104 with death. 'Still worse and worse! He will be in the midst of his
5105 enemies.' And is not our tyrant such a captive soul, who is tormented by
5106 a swarm of passions which he cannot indulge; living indoors always like
5107 a woman, and jealous of those who can go out and see the world?
5108 
5109 Having so many evils, will not the most miserable of men be still more
5110 miserable in a public station? Master of others when he is not master of
5111 himself; like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete; the meanest
5112 of slaves and the most abject of flatterers; wanting all things, and
5113 never able to satisfy his desires; always in fear and distraction,
5114 like the State of which he is the representative. His jealous,
5115 hateful, faithless temper grows worse with command; he is more and more
5116 faithless, envious, unrighteous,--the most wretched of men, a misery
5117 to himself and to others. And so let us have a final trial and
5118 proclamation; need we hire a herald, or shall I proclaim the result?
5119 'Made the proclamation yourself.' The son of Ariston (the best) is of
5120 opinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest, and that
5121 this is he who is the most royal master of himself; and that the unjust
5122 man is he who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of his State. And I
5123 add further--'seen or unseen by gods or men.'
5124 
5125 This is our first proof. The second is derived from the three kinds
5126 of pleasure, which answer to the three elements of the soul--reason,
5127 passion, desire; under which last is comprehended avarice as well as
5128 sensual appetite, while passion includes ambition, party-feeling, love
5129 of reputation. Reason, again, is solely directed to the attainment of
5130 truth, and careless of money and reputation. In accordance with the
5131 difference of men's natures, one of these three principles is in the
5132 ascendant, and they have their several pleasures corresponding to them.
5133 Interrogate now the three natures, and each one will be found praising
5134 his own pleasures and depreciating those of others. The money-maker will
5135 contrast the vanity of knowledge with the solid advantages of wealth.
5136 The ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no honour; whereas
5137 the philosopher will regard only the fruition of truth, and will call
5138 other pleasures necessary rather than good. Now, how shall we decide
5139 between them? Is there any better criterion than experience and
5140 knowledge? And which of the three has the truest knowledge and the
5141 widest experience? The experience of youth makes the philosopher
5142 acquainted with the two kinds of desire, but the avaricious and the
5143 ambitious man never taste the pleasures of truth and wisdom. Honour he
5144 has equally with them; they are 'judged of him,' but he is 'not judged
5145 of them,' for they never attain to the knowledge of true being. And his
5146 instrument is reason, whereas their standard is only wealth and honour;
5147 and if by reason we are to judge, his good will be the truest. And so we
5148 arrive at the result that the pleasure of the rational part of the soul,
5149 and a life passed in such pleasure is the pleasantest. He who has a
5150 right to judge judges thus. Next comes the life of ambition, and, in the
5151 third place, that of money-making.
5152 
5153 Twice has the just man overthrown the unjust--once more, as in an
5154 Olympian contest, first offering up a prayer to the saviour Zeus, let
5155 him try a fall. A wise man whispers to me that the pleasures of the wise
5156 are true and pure; all others are a shadow only. Let us examine this:
5157 Is not pleasure opposed to pain, and is there not a mean state which
5158 is neither? When a man is sick, nothing is more pleasant to him than
5159 health. But this he never found out while he was well. In pain he
5160 desires only to cease from pain; on the other hand, when he is in an
5161 ecstasy of pleasure, rest is painful to him. Thus rest or cessation
5162 is both pleasure and pain. But can that which is neither become both?
5163 Again, pleasure and pain are motions, and the absence of them is rest;
5164 but if so, how can the absence of either of them be the other? Thus
5165 we are led to infer that the contradiction is an appearance only, and
5166 witchery of the senses. And these are not the only pleasures, for there
5167 are others which have no preceding pains. Pure pleasure then is not the
5168 absence of pain, nor pure pain the absence of pleasure; although most of
5169 the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of
5170 pain, and have not only their reactions when they depart, but their
5171 anticipations before they come. They can be best described in a simile.
5172 There is in nature an upper, lower, and middle region, and he who passes
5173 from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is already
5174 in the upper world; and if he were taken back again would think,
5175 and truly think, that he was descending. All this arises out of his
5176 ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions. And a like
5177 confusion happens with pleasure and pain, and with many other things.
5178 The man who compares grey with black, calls grey white; and the man who
5179 compares absence of pain with pain, calls the absence of pain pleasure.
5180 Again, hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body, ignorance and folly
5181 of the soul; and food is the satisfaction of the one, knowledge of the
5182 other. Now which is the purer satisfaction--that of eating and drinking,
5183 or that of knowledge? Consider the matter thus: The satisfaction of
5184 that which has more existence is truer than of that which has less. The
5185 invariable and immortal has a more real existence than the variable
5186 and mortal, and has a corresponding measure of knowledge and truth. The
5187 soul, again, has more existence and truth and knowledge than the body,
5188 and is therefore more really satisfied and has a more natural pleasure.
5189 Those who feast only on earthly food, are always going at random up
5190 to the middle and down again; but they never pass into the true upper
5191 world, or have a taste of true pleasure. They are like fatted beasts,
5192 full of gluttony and sensuality, and ready to kill one another by reason
5193 of their insatiable lust; for they are not filled with true being, and
5194 their vessel is leaky (Gorgias). Their pleasures are mere shadows of
5195 pleasure, mixed with pain, coloured and intensified by contrast,
5196 and therefore intensely desired; and men go fighting about them, as
5197 Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at
5198 Troy, because they know not the truth.
5199 
5200 The same may be said of the passionate element:--the desires of
5201 the ambitious soul, as well as of the covetous, have an inferior
5202 satisfaction. Only when under the guidance of reason do either of the
5203 other principles do their own business or attain the pleasure which is
5204 natural to them. When not attaining, they compel the other parts of the
5205 soul to pursue a shadow of pleasure which is not theirs. And the more
5206 distant they are from philosophy and reason, the more distant they will
5207 be from law and order, and the more illusive will be their pleasures.
5208 The desires of love and tyranny are the farthest from law, and those
5209 of the king are nearest to it. There is one genuine pleasure, and two
5210 spurious ones: the tyrant goes beyond even the latter; he has run away
5211 altogether from law and reason. Nor can the measure of his inferiority
5212 be told, except in a figure. The tyrant is the third removed from the
5213 oligarch, and has therefore, not a shadow of his pleasure, but the
5214 shadow of a shadow only. The oligarch, again, is thrice removed from
5215 the king, and thus we get the formula 3 x 3, which is the number of a
5216 surface, representing the shadow which is the tyrant's pleasure, and
5217 if you like to cube this 'number of the beast,' you will find that the
5218 measure of the difference amounts to 729; the king is 729 times more
5219 happy than the tyrant. And this extraordinary number is NEARLY equal
5220 to the number of days and nights in a year (365 x 2 = 730); and is
5221 therefore concerned with human life. This is the interval between a good
5222 and bad man in happiness only: what must be the difference between them
5223 in comeliness of life and virtue!
5224 
5225 Perhaps you may remember some one saying at the beginning of our
5226 discussion that the unjust man was profited if he had the reputation of
5227 justice. Now that we know the nature of justice and injustice, let us
5228 make an image of the soul, which will personify his words. First of all,
5229 fashion a multitudinous beast, having a ring of heads of all manner of
5230 animals, tame and wild, and able to produce and change them at pleasure.
5231 Suppose now another form of a lion, and another of a man; the second
5232 smaller than the first, the third than the second; join them together
5233 and cover them with a human skin, in which they are completely
5234 concealed. When this has been done, let us tell the supporter of
5235 injustice that he is feeding up the beasts and starving the man. The
5236 maintainer of justice, on the other hand, is trying to strengthen the
5237 man; he is nourishing the gentle principle within him, and making an
5238 alliance with the lion heart, in order that he may be able to keep down
5239 the many-headed hydra, and bring all into unity with each other and
5240 with themselves. Thus in every point of view, whether in relation to
5241 pleasure, honour, or advantage, the just man is right, and the unjust
5242 wrong.
5243 
5244 But now, let us reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally in
5245 error. Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or
5246 rather to the God in man; the ignoble, that which subjects the man to
5247 the beast? And if so, who would receive gold on condition that he was to
5248 degrade the noblest part of himself under the worst?--who would sell his
5249 son or daughter into the hands of brutal and evil men, for any amount
5250 of money? And will he sell his own fairer and diviner part without any
5251 compunction to the most godless and foul? Would he not be worse than
5252 Eriphyle, who sold her husband's life for a necklace? And intemperance
5253 is the letting loose of the multiform monster, and pride and sullenness
5254 are the growth and increase of the lion and serpent element, while
5255 luxury and effeminacy are caused by a too great relaxation of spirit.
5256 Flattery and meanness again arise when the spirited element is subjected
5257 to avarice, and the lion is habituated to become a monkey. The real
5258 disgrace of handicraft arts is, that those who are engaged in them have
5259 to flatter, instead of mastering their desires; therefore we say that
5260 they should be placed under the control of the better principle in
5261 another because they have none in themselves; not, as Thrasymachus
5262 imagined, to the injury of the subjects, but for their good. And our
5263 intention in educating the young, is to give them self-control; the
5264 law desires to nurse up in them a higher principle, and when they have
5265 acquired this, they may go their ways.
5266 
5267 'What, then, shall a man profit, if he gain the whole world' and become
5268 more and more wicked? Or what shall he profit by escaping discovery, if
5269 the concealment of evil prevents the cure? If he had been punished,
5270 the brute within him would have been silenced, and the gentler element
5271 liberated; and he would have united temperance, justice, and wisdom in
5272 his soul--a union better far than any combination of bodily gifts. The
5273 man of understanding will honour knowledge above all; in the next
5274 place he will keep under his body, not only for the sake of health and
5275 strength, but in order to attain the most perfect harmony of body
5276 and soul. In the acquisition of riches, too, he will aim at order and
5277 harmony; he will not desire to heap up wealth without measure, but he
5278 will fear that the increase of wealth will disturb the constitution of
5279 his own soul. For the same reason he will only accept such honours as
5280 will make him a better man; any others he will decline. 'In that case,'
5281 said he, 'he will never be a politician.' Yes, but he will, in his own
5282 city; though probably not in his native country, unless by some divine
5283 accident. 'You mean that he will be a citizen of the ideal city, which
5284 has no place upon earth.' But in heaven, I replied, there is a pattern
5285 of such a city, and he who wishes may order his life after that image.
5286 Whether such a state is or ever will be matters not; he will act
5287 according to that pattern and no other...
5288 
5289 The most noticeable points in the 9th Book of the Republic are:--(1) the
5290 account of pleasure; (2) the number of the interval which divides the
5291 king from the tyrant; (3) the pattern which is in heaven.
5292 
5293 1. Plato's account of pleasure is remarkable for moderation, and in
5294 this respect contrasts with the later Platonists and the views which are
5295 attributed to them by Aristotle. He is not, like the Cynics, opposed
5296 to all pleasure, but rather desires that the several parts of the
5297 soul shall have their natural satisfaction; he even agrees with the
5298 Epicureans in describing pleasure as something more than the absence of
5299 pain. This is proved by the circumstance that there are pleasures which
5300 have no antecedent pains (as he also remarks in the Philebus), such as
5301 the pleasures of smell, and also the pleasures of hope and anticipation.
5302 In the previous book he had made the distinction between necessary
5303 and unnecessary pleasure, which is repeated by Aristotle, and he now
5304 observes that there are a further class of 'wild beast' pleasures,
5305 corresponding to Aristotle's (Greek). He dwells upon the relative and
5306 unreal character of sensual pleasures and the illusion which arises out
5307 of the contrast of pleasure and pain, pointing out the superiority of
5308 the pleasures of reason, which are at rest, over the fleeting pleasures
5309 of sense and emotion. The pre-eminence of royal pleasure is shown by
5310 the fact that reason is able to form a judgment of the lower pleasures,
5311 while the two lower parts of the soul are incapable of judging the
5312 pleasures of reason. Thus, in his treatment of pleasure, as in many
5313 other subjects, the philosophy of Plato is 'sawn up into quantities' by
5314 Aristotle; the analysis which was originally made by him became in the
5315 next generation the foundation of further technical distinctions. Both
5316 in Plato and Aristotle we note the illusion under which the ancients
5317 fell of regarding the transience of pleasure as a proof of its
5318 unreality, and of confounding the permanence of the intellectual
5319 pleasures with the unchangeableness of the knowledge from which they are
5320 derived. Neither do we like to admit that the pleasures of knowledge,
5321 though more elevating, are not more lasting than other pleasures,
5322 and are almost equally dependent on the accidents of our bodily state
5323 (Introduction to Philebus).
5324 
5325 2. The number of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant,
5326 and royal from tyrannical pleasures, is 729, the cube of 9. Which Plato
5327 characteristically designates as a number concerned with human life,
5328 because NEARLY equivalent to the number of days and nights in the
5329 year. He is desirous of proclaiming that the interval between them is
5330 immeasurable, and invents a formula to give expression to his idea.
5331 Those who spoke of justice as a cube, of virtue as an art of measuring
5332 (Prot.), saw no inappropriateness in conceiving the soul under the
5333 figure of a line, or the pleasure of the tyrant as separated from the
5334 pleasure of the king by the numerical interval of 729. And in modern
5335 times we sometimes use metaphorically what Plato employed as a
5336 philosophical formula. 'It is not easy to estimate the loss of the
5337 tyrant, except perhaps in this way,' says Plato. So we might say, that
5338 although the life of a good man is not to be compared to that of a bad
5339 man, yet you may measure the difference between them by valuing one
5340 minute of the one at an hour of the other ('One day in thy courts is
5341 better than a thousand'), or you might say that 'there is an infinite
5342 difference.' But this is not so much as saying, in homely phrase, 'They
5343 are a thousand miles asunder.' And accordingly Plato finds the natural
5344 vehicle of his thoughts in a progression of numbers; this arithmetical
5345 formula he draws out with the utmost seriousness, and both here and in
5346 the number of generation seems to find an additional proof of the truth
5347 of his speculation in forming the number into a geometrical figure; just
5348 as persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement is verified
5349 when it has been only thrown into an abstract form. In speaking of the
5350 number 729 as proper to human life, he probably intended to intimate
5351 that one year of the tyrannical = 12 hours of the royal life.
5352 
5353 The simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids
5354 is effected by the comparison of the cubes of their sides, is the
5355 mathematical groundwork of this fanciful expression. There is some
5356 difficulty in explaining the steps by which the number 729 is obtained;
5357 the oligarch is removed in the third degree from the royal and
5358 aristocratical, and the tyrant in the third degree from the
5359 oligarchical; but we have to arrange the terms as the sides of a square
5360 and to count the oligarch twice over, thus reckoning them not as = 5 but
5361 as = 9. The square of 9 is passed lightly over as only a step towards
5362 the cube.
5363 
5364 3. Towards the close of the Republic, Plato seems to be more and more
5365 convinced of the ideal character of his own speculations. At the end of
5366 the 9th Book the pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the
5367 city of philosophers on earth. The vision which has received form and
5368 substance at his hands, is now discovered to be at a distance. And yet
5369 this distant kingdom is also the rule of man's life. ('Say not lo! here,
5370 or lo! there, for the kingdom of God is within you.') Thus a note
5371 is struck which prepares for the revelation of a future life in the
5372 following Book. But the future life is present still; the ideal of
5373 politics is to be realized in the individual.
5374 
5375 BOOK X. Many things pleased me in the order of our State, but there
5376 was nothing which I liked better than the regulation about poetry. The
5377 division of the soul throws a new light on our exclusion of imitation.
5378 I do not mind telling you in confidence that all poetry is an outrage on
5379 the understanding, unless the hearers have that balm of knowledge which
5380 heals error. I have loved Homer ever since I was a boy, and even now
5381 he appears to me to be the great master of tragic poetry. But much as
5382 I love the man, I love truth more, and therefore I must speak out: and
5383 first of all, will you explain what is imitation, for really I do not
5384 understand? 'How likely then that I should understand!' That might very
5385 well be, for the duller often sees better than the keener eye. 'True,
5386 but in your presence I can hardly venture to say what I think.'
5387 Then suppose that we begin in our old fashion, with the doctrine of
5388 universals. Let us assume the existence of beds and tables. There is one
5389 idea of a bed, or of a table, which the maker of each had in his mind
5390 when making them; he did not make the ideas of beds and tables, but he
5391 made beds and tables according to the ideas. And is there not a maker
5392 of the works of all workmen, who makes not only vessels but plants and
5393 animals, himself, the earth and heaven, and things in heaven and under
5394 the earth? He makes the Gods also. 'He must be a wizard indeed!' But do
5395 you not see that there is a sense in which you could do the same? You
5396 have only to take a mirror, and catch the reflection of the sun, and the
5397 earth, or anything else--there now you have made them. 'Yes, but only
5398 in appearance.' Exactly so; and the painter is such a creator as you are
5399 with the mirror, and he is even more unreal than the carpenter; although
5400 neither the carpenter nor any other artist can be supposed to make the
5401 absolute bed. 'Not if philosophers may be believed.' Nor need we wonder
5402 that his bed has but an imperfect relation to the truth. Reflect:--Here
5403 are three beds; one in nature, which is made by God; another, which is
5404 made by the carpenter; and the third, by the painter. God only made one,
5405 nor could he have made more than one; for if there had been two, there
5406 would always have been a third--more absolute and abstract than either,
5407 under which they would have been included. We may therefore conceive God
5408 to be the natural maker of the bed, and in a lower sense the carpenter
5409 is also the maker; but the painter is rather the imitator of what the
5410 other two make; he has to do with a creation which is thrice removed
5411 from reality. And the tragic poet is an imitator, and, like every
5412 other imitator, is thrice removed from the king and from the truth.
5413 The painter imitates not the original bed, but the bed made by the
5414 carpenter. And this, without being really different, appears to be
5415 different, and has many points of view, of which only one is caught by
5416 the painter, who represents everything because he represents a piece of
5417 everything, and that piece an image. And he can paint any other artist,
5418 although he knows nothing of their arts; and this with sufficient skill
5419 to deceive children or simple people. Suppose now that somebody came to
5420 us and told us, how he had met a man who knew all that everybody knows,
5421 and better than anybody:--should we not infer him to be a simpleton who,
5422 having no discernment of truth and falsehood, had met with a wizard
5423 or enchanter, whom he fancied to be all-wise? And when we hear persons
5424 saying that Homer and the tragedians know all the arts and all the
5425 virtues, must we not infer that they are under a similar delusion? they
5426 do not see that the poets are imitators, and that their creations are
5427 only imitations. 'Very true.' But if a person could create as well as
5428 imitate, he would rather leave some permanent work and not an imitation
5429 only; he would rather be the receiver than the giver of praise? 'Yes,
5430 for then he would have more honour and advantage.'
5431 
5432 Let us now interrogate Homer and the poets. Friend Homer, say I to him,
5433 I am not going to ask you about medicine, or any art to which your
5434 poems incidentally refer, but about their main subjects--war, military
5435 tactics, politics. If you are only twice and not thrice removed from the
5436 truth--not an imitator or an image-maker, please to inform us what good
5437 you have ever done to mankind? Is there any city which professes to have
5438 received laws from you, as Sicily and Italy have from Charondas, Sparta
5439 from Lycurgus, Athens from Solon? Or was any war ever carried on by your
5440 counsels? or is any invention attributed to you, as there is to Thales
5441 and Anacharsis? Or is there any Homeric way of life, such as the
5442 Pythagorean was, in which you instructed men, and which is called after
5443 you? 'No, indeed; and Creophylus (Flesh-child) was even more unfortunate
5444 in his breeding than he was in his name, if, as tradition says, Homer in
5445 his lifetime was allowed by him and his other friends to starve.' Yes,
5446 but could this ever have happened if Homer had really been the educator
5447 of Hellas? Would he not have had many devoted followers? If Protagoras
5448 and Prodicus can persuade their contemporaries that no one can manage
5449 house or State without them, is it likely that Homer and Hesiod would
5450 have been allowed to go about as beggars--I mean if they had really been
5451 able to do the world any good?--would not men have compelled them
5452 to stay where they were, or have followed them about in order to get
5453 education? But they did not; and therefore we may infer that Homer and
5454 all the poets are only imitators, who do but imitate the appearances of
5455 things. For as a painter by a knowledge of figure and colour can paint a
5456 cobbler without any practice in cobbling, so the poet can delineate
5457 any art in the colours of language, and give harmony and rhythm to the
5458 cobbler and also to the general; and you know how mere narration, when
5459 deprived of the ornaments of metre, is like a face which has lost the
5460 beauty of youth and never had any other. Once more, the imitator has no
5461 knowledge of reality, but only of appearance. The painter paints, and
5462 the artificer makes a bridle and reins, but neither understands the use
5463 of them--the knowledge of this is confined to the horseman; and so of
5464 other things. Thus we have three arts: one of use, another of invention,
5465 a third of imitation; and the user furnishes the rule to the two others.
5466 The flute-player will know the good and bad flute, and the maker
5467 will put faith in him; but the imitator will neither know nor have
5468 faith--neither science nor true opinion can be ascribed to him.
5469 Imitation, then, is devoid of knowledge, being only a kind of play
5470 or sport, and the tragic and epic poets are imitators in the highest
5471 degree.
5472 
5473 And now let us enquire, what is the faculty in man which answers to
5474 imitation. Allow me to explain my meaning: Objects are differently seen
5475 when in the water and when out of the water, when near and when at a
5476 distance; and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to
5477 impose upon us. And the art of measuring and weighing and calculating
5478 comes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance; for,
5479 as we were saying, two contrary opinions of the same about the same and
5480 at the same time, cannot both of them be true. But which of them is
5481 true is determined by the art of calculation; and this is allied to the
5482 better faculty in the soul, as the arts of imitation are to the worse.
5483 And the same holds of the ear as well as of the eye, of poetry as well
5484 as painting. The imitation is of actions voluntary or involuntary,
5485 in which there is an expectation of a good or bad result, and present
5486 experience of pleasure and pain. But is a man in harmony with himself
5487 when he is the subject of these conflicting influences? Is there not
5488 rather a contradiction in him? Let me further ask, whether he is more
5489 likely to control sorrow when he is alone or when he is in company.
5490 'In the latter case.' Feeling would lead him to indulge his sorrow, but
5491 reason and law control him and enjoin patience; since he cannot know
5492 whether his affliction is good or evil, and no human thing is of
5493 any great consequence, while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to good
5494 counsel. For when we stumble, we should not, like children, make an
5495 uproar; we should take the measures which reason prescribes, not raising
5496 a lament, but finding a cure. And the better part of us is ready to
5497 follow reason, while the irrational principle is full of sorrow and
5498 distraction at the recollection of our troubles. Unfortunately, however,
5499 this latter furnishes the chief materials of the imitative arts. Whereas
5500 reason is ever in repose and cannot easily be displayed, especially to a
5501 mixed multitude who have no experience of her. Thus the poet is like the
5502 painter in two ways: first he paints an inferior degree of truth, and
5503 secondly, he is concerned with an inferior part of the soul. He indulges
5504 the feelings, while he enfeebles the reason; and we refuse to allow him
5505 to have authority over the mind of man; for he has no measure of greater
5506 and less, and is a maker of images and very far gone from truth.
5507 
5508 But we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment--the
5509 power which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings. When we
5510 hear some passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious
5511 length, you know that we sympathize with him and praise the poet; and
5512 yet in our own sorrows such an exhibition of feeling is regarded as
5513 effeminate and unmanly (Ion). Now, ought a man to feel pleasure in
5514 seeing another do what he hates and abominates in himself? Is he not
5515 giving way to a sentiment which in his own case he would control?--he is
5516 off his guard because the sorrow is another's; and he thinks that he
5517 may indulge his feelings without disgrace, and will be the gainer by
5518 the pleasure. But the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by
5519 weeping at the sorrows of others, will end by weeping at his own. The
5520 same is true of comedy,--you may often laugh at buffoonery which you
5521 would be ashamed to utter, and the love of coarse merriment on the stage
5522 will at last turn you into a buffoon at home. Poetry feeds and waters
5523 the passions and desires; she lets them rule instead of ruling them. And
5524 therefore, when we hear the encomiasts of Homer affirming that he is
5525 the educator of Hellas, and that all life should be regulated by his
5526 precepts, we may allow the excellence of their intentions, and agree
5527 with them in thinking Homer a great poet and tragedian. But we shall
5528 continue to prohibit all poetry which goes beyond hymns to the Gods and
5529 praises of famous men. Not pleasure and pain, but law and reason shall
5530 rule in our State.
5531 
5532 These are our grounds for expelling poetry; but lest she should charge
5533 us with discourtesy, let us also make an apology to her. We will remind
5534 her that there is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy, of
5535 which there are many traces in the writings of the poets, such as the
5536 saying of 'the she-dog, yelping at her mistress,' and 'the philosophers
5537 who are ready to circumvent Zeus,' and 'the philosophers who are
5538 paupers.' Nevertheless we bear her no ill-will, and will gladly allow
5539 her to return upon condition that she makes a defence of herself in
5540 verse; and her supporters who are not poets may speak in prose. We
5541 confess her charms; but if she cannot show that she is useful as well
5542 as delightful, like rational lovers, we must renounce our love,
5543 though endeared to us by early associations. Having come to years of
5544 discretion, we know that poetry is not truth, and that a man should be
5545 careful how he introduces her to that state or constitution which he
5546 himself is; for there is a mighty issue at stake--no less than the good
5547 or evil of a human soul. And it is not worth while to forsake justice
5548 and virtue for the attractions of poetry, any more than for the sake of
5549 honour or wealth. 'I agree with you.'
5550 
5551 And yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than I have described.
5552 'And can we conceive things greater still?' Not, perhaps, in this brief
5553 span of life: but should an immortal being care about anything short of
5554 eternity? 'I do not understand what you mean?' Do you not know that the
5555 soul is immortal? 'Surely you are not prepared to prove that?' Indeed I
5556 am. 'Then let me hear this argument, of which you make so light.'
5557 
5558 You would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil. In
5559 all things there is an inherent corruption; and if this cannot destroy
5560 them, nothing else will. The soul too has her own corrupting principles,
5561 which are injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and the like. But none of
5562 these destroy the soul in the same sense that disease destroys the body.
5563 The soul may be full of all iniquities, but is not, by reason of them,
5564 brought any nearer to death. Nothing which was not destroyed from within
5565 ever perished by external affection of evil. The body, which is one
5566 thing, cannot be destroyed by food, which is another, unless the badness
5567 of the food is communicated to the body. Neither can the soul, which
5568 is one thing, be corrupted by the body, which is another, unless she
5569 herself is infected. And as no bodily evil can infect the soul, neither
5570 can any bodily evil, whether disease or violence, or any other destroy
5571 the soul, unless it can be shown to render her unholy and unjust. But no
5572 one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust when
5573 they die. If a person has the audacity to say the contrary, the answer
5574 is--Then why do criminals require the hand of the executioner, and
5575 not die of themselves? 'Truly,' he said, 'injustice would not be very
5576 terrible if it brought a cessation of evil; but I rather believe that
5577 the injustice which murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate
5578 the life of the unjust.' You are quite right. If sin which is her own
5579 natural and inherent evil cannot destroy the soul, hardly will anything
5580 else destroy her. But the soul which cannot be destroyed either by
5581 internal or external evil must be immortal and everlasting. And if
5582 this be true, souls will always exist in the same number. They cannot
5583 diminish, because they cannot be destroyed; nor yet increase, for the
5584 increase of the immortal must come from something mortal, and so all
5585 would end in immortality. Neither is the soul variable and diverse; for
5586 that which is immortal must be of the fairest and simplest composition.
5587 If we would conceive her truly, and so behold justice and injustice in
5588 their own nature, she must be viewed by the light of reason pure as at
5589 birth, or as she is reflected in philosophy when holding converse with
5590 the divine and immortal and eternal. In her present condition we see her
5591 only like the sea-god Glaucus, bruised and maimed in the sea which is
5592 the world, and covered with shells and stones which are incrusted upon
5593 her from the entertainments of earth.
5594 
5595 Thus far, as the argument required, we have said nothing of the rewards
5596 and honours which the poets attribute to justice; we have contented
5597 ourselves with showing that justice in herself is best for the soul in
5598 herself, even if a man should put on a Gyges' ring and have the helmet
5599 of Hades too. And now you shall repay me what you borrowed; and I will
5600 enumerate the rewards of justice in life and after death. I granted,
5601 for the sake of argument, as you will remember, that evil might
5602 perhaps escape the knowledge of Gods and men, although this was really
5603 impossible. And since I have shown that justice has reality, you must
5604 grant me also that she has the palm of appearance. In the first place,
5605 the just man is known to the Gods, and he is therefore the friend of the
5606 Gods, and he will receive at their hands every good, always excepting
5607 such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins. All things end
5608 in good to him, either in life or after death, even what appears to
5609 be evil; for the Gods have a care of him who desires to be in their
5610 likeness. And what shall we say of men? Is not honesty the best policy?
5611 The clever rogue makes a great start at first, but breaks down before he
5612 reaches the goal, and slinks away in dishonour; whereas the true runner
5613 perseveres to the end, and receives the prize. And you must allow me
5614 to repeat all the blessings which you attributed to the fortunate
5615 unjust--they bear rule in the city, they marry and give in marriage to
5616 whom they will; and the evils which you attributed to the unfortunate
5617 just, do really fall in the end on the unjust, although, as you implied,
5618 their sufferings are better veiled in silence.
5619 
5620 But all the blessings of this present life are as nothing when compared
5621 with those which await good men after death. 'I should like to hear
5622 about them.' Come, then, and I will tell you the story of Er, the son of
5623 Armenius, a valiant man. He was supposed to have died in battle, but ten
5624 days afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent home
5625 for burial. On the twelfth day he was placed on the funeral pyre and
5626 there he came to life again, and told what he had seen in the world
5627 below. He said that his soul went with a great company to a place, in
5628 which there were two chasms near together in the earth beneath, and two
5629 corresponding chasms in the heaven above. And there were judges sitting
5630 in the intermediate space, bidding the just ascend by the heavenly
5631 way on the right hand, having the seal of their judgment set upon them
5632 before, while the unjust, having the seal behind, were bidden to descend
5633 by the way on the left hand. Him they told to look and listen, as he was
5634 to be their messenger to men from the world below. And he beheld and saw
5635 the souls departing after judgment at either chasm; some who came from
5636 earth, were worn and travel-stained; others, who came from heaven,
5637 were clean and bright. They seemed glad to meet and rest awhile in the
5638 meadow; here they discoursed with one another of what they had seen in
5639 the other world. Those who came from earth wept at the remembrance of
5640 their sorrows, but the spirits from above spoke of glorious sights and
5641 heavenly bliss. He said that for every evil deed they were punished
5642 tenfold--now the journey was of a thousand years' duration, because the
5643 life of man was reckoned as a hundred years--and the rewards of virtue
5644 were in the same proportion. He added something hardly worth repeating
5645 about infants dying almost as soon as they were born. Of parricides and
5646 other murderers he had tortures still more terrible to narrate. He was
5647 present when one of the spirits asked--Where is Ardiaeus the Great?
5648 (This Ardiaeus was a cruel tyrant, who had murdered his father, and his
5649 elder brother, a thousand years before.) Another spirit answered,
5650 'He comes not hither, and will never come. And I myself,' he added,
5651 'actually saw this terrible sight. At the entrance of the chasm, as we
5652 were about to reascend, Ardiaeus appeared, and some other sinners--most
5653 of whom had been tyrants, but not all--and just as they fancied that
5654 they were returning to life, the chasm gave a roar, and then wild,
5655 fiery-looking men who knew the meaning of the sound, seized him and
5656 several others, and bound them hand and foot and threw them down, and
5657 dragged them along at the side of the road, lacerating them and carding
5658 them like wool, and explaining to the passers-by, that they were going
5659 to be cast into hell.' The greatest terror of the pilgrims ascending was
5660 lest they should hear the voice, and when there was silence one by one
5661 they passed up with joy. To these sufferings there were corresponding
5662 delights.
5663 
5664 On the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey,
5665 and in four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of
5666 light, in colour like a rainbow, only brighter and clearer. One day
5667 more brought them to the place, and they saw that this was the column
5668 of light which binds together the whole universe. The ends of the column
5669 were fastened to heaven, and from them hung the distaff of Necessity,
5670 on which all the heavenly bodies turned--the hook and spindle were of
5671 adamant, and the whorl of a mixed substance. The whorl was in form
5672 like a number of boxes fitting into one another with their edges
5673 turned upwards, making together a single whorl which was pierced by the
5674 spindle. The outermost had the rim broadest, and the inner whorls were
5675 smaller and smaller, and had their rims narrower. The largest (the fixed
5676 stars) was spangled--the seventh (the sun) was brightest--the eighth
5677 (the moon) shone by the light of the seventh--the second and fifth
5678 (Saturn and Mercury) were most like one another and yellower than the
5679 eighth--the third (Jupiter) had the whitest light--the fourth (Mars)
5680 was red--the sixth (Venus) was in whiteness second. The whole had one
5681 motion, but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner
5682 circles were moving in the opposite, with various degrees of swiftness
5683 and slowness. The spindle turned on the knees of Necessity, and a Siren
5684 stood hymning upon each circle, while Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos, the
5685 daughters of Necessity, sat on thrones at equal intervals, singing of
5686 past, present, and future, responsive to the music of the Sirens; Clotho
5687 from time to time guiding the outer circle with a touch of her right
5688 hand; Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner circles;
5689 Lachesis in turn putting forth her hand from time to time to guide both
5690 of them. On their arrival the pilgrims went to Lachesis, and there was
5691 an interpreter who arranged them, and taking from her knees lots, and
5692 samples of lives, got up into a pulpit and said: 'Mortal souls, hear
5693 the words of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. A new period of
5694 mortal life has begun, and you may choose what divinity you please;
5695 the responsibility of choosing is with you--God is blameless.' After
5696 speaking thus, he cast the lots among them and each one took up the
5697 lot which fell near him. He then placed on the ground before them the
5698 samples of lives, many more than the souls present; and there were all
5699 sorts of lives, of men and of animals. There were tyrannies ending in
5700 misery and exile, and lives of men and women famous for their different
5701 qualities; and also mixed lives, made up of wealth and poverty,
5702 sickness and health. Here, Glaucon, is the great risk of human life, and
5703 therefore the whole of education should be directed to the acquisition
5704 of such a knowledge as will teach a man to refuse the evil and choose
5705 the good. He should know all the combinations which occur in life--of
5706 beauty with poverty or with wealth,--of knowledge with external
5707 goods,--and at last choose with reference to the nature of the soul,
5708 regarding that only as the better life which makes men better, and
5709 leaving the rest. And a man must take with him an iron sense of truth
5710 and right into the world below, that there too he may remain undazzled
5711 by wealth or the allurements of evil, and be determined to avoid the
5712 extremes and choose the mean. For this, as the messenger reported the
5713 interpreter to have said, is the true happiness of man; and any one, as
5714 he proclaimed, may, if he choose with understanding, have a good lot,
5715 even though he come last. 'Let not the first be careless in his choice,
5716 nor the last despair.' He spoke; and when he had spoken, he who had
5717 drawn the first lot chose a tyranny: he did not see that he was fated to
5718 devour his own children--and when he discovered his mistake, he wept
5719 and beat his breast, blaming chance and the Gods and anybody rather
5720 than himself. He was one of those who had come from heaven, and in his
5721 previous life had been a citizen of a well-ordered State, but he had
5722 only habit and no philosophy. Like many another, he made a bad choice,
5723 because he had no experience of life; whereas those who came from earth
5724 and had seen trouble were not in such a hurry to choose. But if a
5725 man had followed philosophy while upon earth, and had been moderately
5726 fortunate in his lot, he might not only be happy here, but his
5727 pilgrimage both from and to this world would be smooth and heavenly.
5728 Nothing was more curious than the spectacle of the choice, at once sad
5729 and laughable and wonderful; most of the souls only seeking to avoid
5730 their own condition in a previous life. He saw the soul of Orpheus
5731 changing into a swan because he would not be born of a woman; there was
5732 Thamyras becoming a nightingale; musical birds, like the swan, choosing
5733 to be men; the twentieth soul, which was that of Ajax, preferring the
5734 life of a lion to that of a man, in remembrance of the injustice which
5735 was done to him in the judgment of the arms; and Agamemnon, from a like
5736 enmity to human nature, passing into an eagle. About the middle was the
5737 soul of Atalanta choosing the honours of an athlete, and next to her
5738 Epeus taking the nature of a workwoman; among the last was Thersites,
5739 who was changing himself into a monkey. Thither, the last of all, came
5740 Odysseus, and sought the lot of a private man, which lay neglected and
5741 despised, and when he found it he went away rejoicing, and said that if
5742 he had been first instead of last, his choice would have been the same.
5743 Men, too, were seen passing into animals, and wild and tame animals
5744 changing into one another.
5745 
5746 When all the souls had chosen they went to Lachesis, who sent with each
5747 of them their genius or attendant to fulfil their lot. He first of
5748 all brought them under the hand of Clotho, and drew them within the
5749 revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand; from her they were
5750 carried to Atropos, who made the threads irreversible; whence, without
5751 turning round, they passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and when
5752 they had all passed, they moved on in scorching heat to the plain of
5753 Forgetfulness and rested at evening by the river Unmindful, whose water
5754 could not be retained in any vessel; of this they had all to drink a
5755 certain quantity--some of them drank more than was required, and he who
5756 drank forgot all things. Er himself was prevented from drinking.
5757 When they had gone to rest, about the middle of the night there were
5758 thunderstorms and earthquakes, and suddenly they were all driven divers
5759 ways, shooting like stars to their birth. Concerning his return to the
5760 body, he only knew that awaking suddenly in the morning he found himself
5761 lying on the pyre.
5762 
5763 Thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved, and will be our salvation, if we
5764 believe that the soul is immortal, and hold fast to the heavenly way
5765 of Justice and Knowledge. So shall we pass undefiled over the river
5766 of Forgetfulness, and be dear to ourselves and to the Gods, and have
5767 a crown of reward and happiness both in this world and also in the
5768 millennial pilgrimage of the other.
5769 
5770 The Tenth Book of the Republic of Plato falls into two divisions: first,
5771 resuming an old thread which has been interrupted, Socrates assails the
5772 poets, who, now that the nature of the soul has been analyzed, are
5773 seen to be very far gone from the truth; and secondly, having shown the
5774 reality of the happiness of the just, he demands that appearance shall
5775 be restored to him, and then proceeds to prove the immortality of the
5776 soul. The argument, as in the Phaedo and Gorgias, is supplemented by the
5777 vision of a future life.
5778 
5779 Why Plato, who was himself a poet, and whose dialogues are poems and
5780 dramas, should have been hostile to the poets as a class, and especially
5781 to the dramatic poets; why he should not have seen that truth may
5782 be embodied in verse as well as in prose, and that there are some
5783 indefinable lights and shadows of human life which can only be expressed
5784 in poetry--some elements of imagination which always entwine with
5785 reason; why he should have supposed epic verse to be inseparably
5786 associated with the impurities of the old Hellenic mythology; why
5787 he should try Homer and Hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of
5788 utility,--are questions which have always been debated amongst students
5789 of Plato. Though unable to give a complete answer to them, we may
5790 show--first, that his views arose naturally out of the circumstances
5791 of his age; and secondly, we may elicit the truth as well as the error
5792 which is contained in them.
5793 
5794 He is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own
5795 lifetime, and a theatrocracy, as he says in the Laws, had taken the
5796 place of an intellectual aristocracy. Euripides exhibited the last phase
5797 of the tragic drama, and in him Plato saw the friend and apologist of
5798 tyrants, and the Sophist of tragedy. The old comedy was almost extinct;
5799 the new had not yet arisen. Dramatic and lyric poetry, like every other
5800 branch of Greek literature, was falling under the power of rhetoric.
5801 There was no 'second or third' to Aeschylus and Sophocles in the
5802 generation which followed them. Aristophanes, in one of his later
5803 comedies (Frogs), speaks of 'thousands of tragedy-making prattlers,'
5804 whose attempts at poetry he compares to the chirping of swallows; 'their
5805 garrulity went far beyond Euripides,'--'they appeared once upon the
5806 stage, and there was an end of them.' To a man of genius who had a
5807 real appreciation of the godlike Aeschylus and the noble and gentle
5808 Sophocles, though disagreeing with some parts of their 'theology'
5809 (Rep.), these 'minor poets' must have been contemptible and intolerable.
5810 There is no feeling stronger in the dialogues of Plato than a sense of
5811 the decline and decay both in literature and in politics which marked
5812 his own age. Nor can he have been expected to look with favour on the
5813 licence of Aristophanes, now at the end of his career, who had begun by
5814 satirizing Socrates in the Clouds, and in a similar spirit forty years
5815 afterwards had satirized the founders of ideal commonwealths in his
5816 Eccleziazusae, or Female Parliament (Laws).
5817 
5818 There were other reasons for the antagonism of Plato to poetry. The
5819 profession of an actor was regarded by him as a degradation of human
5820 nature, for 'one man in his life' cannot 'play many parts;' the
5821 characters which the actor performs seem to destroy his own character,
5822 and to leave nothing which can be truly called himself. Neither can any
5823 man live his life and act it. The actor is the slave of his art, not the
5824 master of it. Taking this view Plato is more decided in his expulsion of
5825 the dramatic than of the epic poets, though he must have known that
5826 the Greek tragedians afforded noble lessons and examples of virtue
5827 and patriotism, to which nothing in Homer can be compared. But great
5828 dramatic or even great rhetorical power is hardly consistent with
5829 firmness or strength of mind, and dramatic talent is often incidentally
5830 associated with a weak or dissolute character.
5831 
5832 In the Tenth Book Plato introduces a new series of objections. First,
5833 he says that the poet or painter is an imitator, and in the third
5834 degree removed from the truth. His creations are not tested by rule and
5835 measure; they are only appearances. In modern times we should say that
5836 art is not merely imitation, but rather the expression of the ideal in
5837 forms of sense. Even adopting the humble image of Plato, from which
5838 his argument derives a colour, we should maintain that the artist may
5839 ennoble the bed which he paints by the folds of the drapery, or by the
5840 feeling of home which he introduces; and there have been modern
5841 painters who have imparted such an ideal interest to a blacksmith's or
5842 a carpenter's shop. The eye or mind which feels as well as sees can give
5843 dignity and pathos to a ruined mill, or a straw-built shed (Rembrandt),
5844 to the hull of a vessel 'going to its last home' (Turner). Still more
5845 would this apply to the greatest works of art, which seem to be the
5846 visible embodiment of the divine. Had Plato been asked whether the Zeus
5847 or Athene of Pheidias was the imitation of an imitation only, would he
5848 not have been compelled to admit that something more was to be found in
5849 them than in the form of any mortal; and that the rule of proportion
5850 to which they conformed was 'higher far than any geometry or arithmetic
5851 could express?' (Statesman.)
5852 
5853 Again, Plato objects to the imitative arts that they express the
5854 emotional rather than the rational part of human nature. He does not
5855 admit Aristotle's theory, that tragedy or other serious imitations are
5856 a purgation of the passions by pity and fear; to him they appear only to
5857 afford the opportunity of indulging them. Yet we must acknowledge that
5858 we may sometimes cure disordered emotions by giving expression to them;
5859 and that they often gain strength when pent up within our own breast.
5860 It is not every indulgence of the feelings which is to be condemned.
5861 For there may be a gratification of the higher as well as of the
5862 lower--thoughts which are too deep or too sad to be expressed by
5863 ourselves, may find an utterance in the words of poets. Every one would
5864 acknowledge that there have been times when they were consoled and
5865 elevated by beautiful music or by the sublimity of architecture or by
5866 the peacefulness of nature. Plato has himself admitted, in the earlier
5867 part of the Republic, that the arts might have the effect of harmonizing
5868 as well as of enervating the mind; but in the Tenth Book he regards them
5869 through a Stoic or Puritan medium. He asks only 'What good have they
5870 done?' and is not satisfied with the reply, that 'They have given
5871 innocent pleasure to mankind.'
5872 
5873 He tells us that he rejoices in the banishment of the poets, since he
5874 has found by the analysis of the soul that they are concerned with the
5875 inferior faculties. He means to say that the higher faculties have to do
5876 with universals, the lower with particulars of sense. The poets are on
5877 a level with their own age, but not on a level with Socrates and Plato;
5878 and he was well aware that Homer and Hesiod could not be made a rule of
5879 life by any process of legitimate interpretation; his ironical use of
5880 them is in fact a denial of their authority; he saw, too, that the
5881 poets were not critics--as he says in the Apology, 'Any one was a better
5882 interpreter of their writings than they were themselves. He himself
5883 ceased to be a poet when he became a disciple of Socrates; though, as he
5884 tells us of Solon, 'he might have been one of the greatest of them, if
5885 he had not been deterred by other pursuits' (Tim.) Thus from many points
5886 of view there is an antagonism between Plato and the poets, which was
5887 foreshadowed to him in the old quarrel between philosophy and poetry.
5888 The poets, as he says in the Protagoras, were the Sophists of their day;
5889 and his dislike of the one class is reflected on the other. He regards
5890 them both as the enemies of reasoning and abstraction, though in the
5891 case of Euripides more with reference to his immoral sentiments about
5892 tyrants and the like. For Plato is the prophet who 'came into the world
5893 to convince men'--first of the fallibility of sense and opinion, and
5894 secondly of the reality of abstract ideas. Whatever strangeness there
5895 may be in modern times in opposing philosophy to poetry, which to us
5896 seem to have so many elements in common, the strangeness will disappear
5897 if we conceive of poetry as allied to sense, and of philosophy as
5898 equivalent to thought and abstraction. Unfortunately the very word
5899 'idea,' which to Plato is expressive of the most real of all things, is
5900 associated in our minds with an element of subjectiveness and unreality.
5901 We may note also how he differs from Aristotle who declares poetry to
5902 be truer than history, for the opposite reason, because it is concerned
5903 with universals, not like history, with particulars (Poet).
5904 
5905 The things which are seen are opposed in Scripture to the things which
5906 are unseen--they are equally opposed in Plato to universals and ideas.
5907 To him all particulars appear to be floating about in a world of sense;
5908 they have a taint of error or even of evil. There is no difficulty in
5909 seeing that this is an illusion; for there is no more error or variation
5910 in an individual man, horse, bed, etc., than in the class man, horse,
5911 bed, etc.; nor is the truth which is displayed in individual instances
5912 less certain than that which is conveyed through the medium of
5913 ideas. But Plato, who is deeply impressed with the real importance of
5914 universals as instruments of thought, attributes to them an essential
5915 truth which is imaginary and unreal; for universals may be often false
5916 and particulars true. Had he attained to any clear conception of the
5917 individual, which is the synthesis of the universal and the particular;
5918 or had he been able to distinguish between opinion and sensation, which
5919 the ambiguity of the words (Greek) and the like, tended to confuse, he
5920 would not have denied truth to the particulars of sense.
5921 
5922 But the poets are also the representatives of falsehood and feigning
5923 in all departments of life and knowledge, like the sophists and
5924 rhetoricians of the Gorgias and Phaedrus; they are the false priests,
5925 false prophets, lying spirits, enchanters of the world. There is another
5926 count put into the indictment against them by Plato, that they are
5927 the friends of the tyrant, and bask in the sunshine of his patronage.
5928 Despotism in all ages has had an apparatus of false ideas and false
5929 teachers at its service--in the history of Modern Europe as well as of
5930 Greece and Rome. For no government of men depends solely upon force;
5931 without some corruption of literature and morals--some appeal to the
5932 imagination of the masses--some pretence to the favour of heaven--some
5933 element of good giving power to evil, tyranny, even for a short time,
5934 cannot be maintained. The Greek tyrants were not insensible to the
5935 importance of awakening in their cause a Pseudo-Hellenic feeling; they
5936 were proud of successes at the Olympic games; they were not devoid of
5937 the love of literature and art. Plato is thinking in the first instance
5938 of Greek poets who had graced the courts of Dionysius or Archelaus: and
5939 the old spirit of freedom is roused within him at their prostitution of
5940 the Tragic Muse in the praises of tyranny. But his prophetic eye extends
5941 beyond them to the false teachers of other ages who are the creatures of
5942 the government under which they live. He compares the corruption of his
5943 contemporaries with the idea of a perfect society, and gathers up
5944 into one mass of evil the evils and errors of mankind; to him they are
5945 personified in the rhetoricians, sophists, poets, rulers who deceive and
5946 govern the world.
5947 
5948 A further objection which Plato makes to poetry and the imitative
5949 arts is that they excite the emotions. Here the modern reader will be
5950 disposed to introduce a distinction which appears to have escaped him.
5951 For the emotions are neither bad nor good in themselves, and are not
5952 most likely to be controlled by the attempt to eradicate them, but by
5953 the moderate indulgence of them. And the vocation of art is to present
5954 thought in the form of feeling, to enlist the feelings on the side of
5955 reason, to inspire even for a moment courage or resignation; perhaps to
5956 suggest a sense of infinity and eternity in a way which mere language is
5957 incapable of attaining. True, the same power which in the purer age of
5958 art embodies gods and heroes only, may be made to express the voluptuous
5959 image of a Corinthian courtezan. But this only shows that art, like
5960 other outward things, may be turned to good and also to evil, and is not
5961 more closely connected with the higher than with the lower part of the
5962 soul. All imitative art is subject to certain limitations, and therefore
5963 necessarily partakes of the nature of a compromise. Something of ideal
5964 truth is sacrificed for the sake of the representation, and something in
5965 the exactness of the representation is sacrificed to the ideal. Still,
5966 works of art have a permanent element; they idealize and detain the
5967 passing thought, and are the intermediates between sense and ideas.
5968 
5969 In the present stage of the human mind, poetry and other forms of
5970 fiction may certainly be regarded as a good. But we can also imagine the
5971 existence of an age in which a severer conception of truth has either
5972 banished or transformed them. At any rate we must admit that they hold
5973 a different place at different periods of the world's history. In the
5974 infancy of mankind, poetry, with the exception of proverbs, is the
5975 whole of literature, and the only instrument of intellectual culture; in
5976 modern times she is the shadow or echo of her former self, and appears
5977 to have a precarious existence. Milton in his day doubted whether an
5978 epic poem was any longer possible. At the same time we must remember,
5979 that what Plato would have called the charms of poetry have been partly
5980 transferred to prose; he himself (Statesman) admits rhetoric to be the
5981 handmaiden of Politics, and proposes to find in the strain of law (Laws)
5982 a substitute for the old poets. Among ourselves the creative power seems
5983 often to be growing weaker, and scientific fact to be more engrossing
5984 and overpowering to the mind than formerly. The illusion of the feelings
5985 commonly called love, has hitherto been the inspiring influence of
5986 modern poetry and romance, and has exercised a humanizing if not a
5987 strengthening influence on the world. But may not the stimulus which
5988 love has given to fancy be some day exhausted? The modern English novel
5989 which is the most popular of all forms of reading is not more than a
5990 century or two old: will the tale of love a hundred years hence, after
5991 so many thousand variations of the same theme, be still received with
5992 unabated interest?
5993 
5994 Art cannot claim to be on a level with philosophy or religion, and may
5995 often corrupt them. It is possible to conceive a mental state in which
5996 all artistic representations are regarded as a false and imperfect
5997 expression, either of the religious ideal or of the philosophical ideal.
5998 The fairest forms may be revolting in certain moods of mind, as is
5999 proved by the fact that the Mahometans, and many sects of Christians,
6000 have renounced the use of pictures and images. The beginning of a great
6001 religion, whether Christian or Gentile, has not been 'wood or stone,'
6002 but a spirit moving in the hearts of men. The disciples have met in a
6003 large upper room or in 'holes and caves of the earth'; in the second or
6004 third generation, they have had mosques, temples, churches, monasteries.
6005 And the revival or reform of religions, like the first revelation
6006 of them, has come from within and has generally disregarded external
6007 ceremonies and accompaniments.
6008 
6009 But poetry and art may also be the expression of the highest truth and
6010 the purest sentiment. Plato himself seems to waver between two opposite
6011 views--when, as in the third Book, he insists that youth should be
6012 brought up amid wholesome imagery; and again in Book X, when he banishes
6013 the poets from his Republic. Admitting that the arts, which some of us
6014 almost deify, have fallen short of their higher aim, we must admit on
6015 the other hand that to banish imagination wholly would be suicidal as
6016 well as impossible. For nature too is a form of art; and a breath of
6017 the fresh air or a single glance at the varying landscape would in an
6018 instant revive and reillumine the extinguished spark of poetry in the
6019 human breast. In the lower stages of civilization imagination more than
6020 reason distinguishes man from the animals; and to banish art would be
6021 to banish thought, to banish language, to banish the expression of
6022 all truth. No religion is wholly devoid of external forms; even the
6023 Mahometan who renounces the use of pictures and images has a temple in
6024 which he worships the Most High, as solemn and beautiful as any Greek or
6025 Christian building. Feeling too and thought are not really opposed; for
6026 he who thinks must feel before he can execute. And the highest thoughts,
6027 when they become familiarized to us, are always tending to pass into the
6028 form of feeling.
6029 
6030 Plato does not seriously intend to expel poets from life and society.
6031 But he feels strongly the unreality of their writings; he is protesting
6032 against the degeneracy of poetry in his own day as we might protest
6033 against the want of serious purpose in modern fiction, against the
6034 unseemliness or extravagance of some of our poets or novelists,
6035 against the time-serving of preachers or public writers, against the
6036 regardlessness of truth which to the eye of the philosopher seems to
6037 characterize the greater part of the world. For we too have reason to
6038 complain that our poets and novelists 'paint inferior truth' and 'are
6039 concerned with the inferior part of the soul'; that the readers of them
6040 become what they read and are injuriously affected by them. And we look
6041 in vain for that healthy atmosphere of which Plato speaks,--'the beauty
6042 which meets the sense like a breeze and imperceptibly draws the soul,
6043 even in childhood, into harmony with the beauty of reason.'
6044 
6045 For there might be a poetry which would be the hymn of divine
6046 perfection, the harmony of goodness and truth among men: a strain which
6047 should renew the youth of the world, and bring back the ages in which
6048 the poet was man's only teacher and best friend,--which would find
6049 materials in the living present as well as in the romance of the
6050 past, and might subdue to the fairest forms of speech and verse the
6051 intractable materials of modern civilisation,--which might elicit the
6052 simple principles, or, as Plato would have called them, the essential
6053 forms, of truth and justice out of the variety of opinion and the
6054 complexity of modern society,--which would preserve all the good of each
6055 generation and leave the bad unsung,--which should be based not on vain
6056 longings or faint imaginings, but on a clear insight into the nature of
6057 man. Then the tale of love might begin again in poetry or prose, two in
6058 one, united in the pursuit of knowledge, or the service of God and man;
6059 and feelings of love might still be the incentive to great thoughts
6060 and heroic deeds as in the days of Dante or Petrarch; and many types
6061 of manly and womanly beauty might appear among us, rising above the
6062 ordinary level of humanity, and many lives which were like poems (Laws),
6063 be not only written, but lived by us. A few such strains have been
6064 heard among men in the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles, whom Plato
6065 quotes, not, as Homer is quoted by him, in irony, but with deep and
6066 serious approval,--in the poetry of Milton and Wordsworth, and in
6067 passages of other English poets,--first and above all in the Hebrew
6068 prophets and psalmists. Shakespeare has taught us how great men should
6069 speak and act; he has drawn characters of a wonderful purity and depth;
6070 he has ennobled the human mind, but, like Homer (Rep.), he 'has left
6071 no way of life.' The next greatest poet of modern times, Goethe, is
6072 concerned with 'a lower degree of truth'; he paints the world as a stage
6073 on which 'all the men and women are merely players'; he cultivates life
6074 as an art, but he furnishes no ideals of truth and action. The poet may
6075 rebel against any attempt to set limits to his fancy; and he may
6076 argue truly that moralizing in verse is not poetry. Possibly, like
6077 Mephistopheles in Faust, he may retaliate on his adversaries. But the
6078 philosopher will still be justified in asking, 'How may the heavenly
6079 gift of poesy be devoted to the good of mankind?'
6080 
6081 Returning to Plato, we may observe that a similar mixture of truth
6082 and error appears in other parts of the argument. He is aware of the
6083 absurdity of mankind framing their whole lives according to Homer; just
6084 as in the Phaedrus he intimates the absurdity of interpreting mythology
6085 upon rational principles; both these were the modern tendencies of his
6086 own age, which he deservedly ridicules. On the other hand, his argument
6087 that Homer, if he had been able to teach mankind anything worth knowing,
6088 would not have been allowed by them to go about begging as a rhapsodist,
6089 is both false and contrary to the spirit of Plato (Rep.). It may be
6090 compared with those other paradoxes of the Gorgias, that 'No statesman
6091 was ever unjustly put to death by the city of which he was the head';
6092 and that 'No Sophist was ever defrauded by his pupils' (Gorg.)...

6094 The argument for immortality seems to rest on the absolute dualism of
6095 soul and body. Admitting the existence of the soul, we know of no force
6096 which is able to put an end to her. Vice is her own proper evil; and if
6097 she cannot be destroyed by that, she cannot be destroyed by any other.
6098 Yet Plato has acknowledged that the soul may be so overgrown by the
6099 incrustations of earth as to lose her original form; and in the Timaeus
6100 he recognizes more strongly than in the Republic the influence which the
6101 body has over the mind, denying even the voluntariness of human actions,
6102 on the ground that they proceed from physical states (Tim.). In the
6103 Republic, as elsewhere, he wavers between the original soul which has
6104 to be restored, and the character which is developed by training and
6105 education...
6106 
6107 The vision of another world is ascribed to Er, the son of Armenius, who
6108 is said by Clement of Alexandria to have been Zoroaster. The tale
6109 has certainly an oriental character, and may be compared with the
6110 pilgrimages of the soul in the Zend Avesta (Haug, Avesta). But no trace
6111 of acquaintance with Zoroaster is found elsewhere in Plato's writings,
6112 and there is no reason for giving him the name of Er the Pamphylian. The
6113 philosophy of Heracleitus cannot be shown to be borrowed from Zoroaster,
6114 and still less the myths of Plato.
6115 
6116 The local arrangement of the vision is less distinct than that of the
6117 Phaedrus and Phaedo. Astronomy is mingled with symbolism and mythology;
6118 the great sphere of heaven is represented under the symbol of a cylinder
6119 or box, containing the seven orbits of the planets and the fixed stars;
6120 this is suspended from an axis or spindle which turns on the knees of
6121 Necessity; the revolutions of the seven orbits contained in the cylinder
6122 are guided by the fates, and their harmonious motion produces the music
6123 of the spheres. Through the innermost or eighth of these, which is the
6124 moon, is passed the spindle; but it is doubtful whether this is the
6125 continuation of the column of light, from which the pilgrims contemplate
6126 the heavens; the words of Plato imply that they are connected, but
6127 not the same. The column itself is clearly not of adamant. The spindle
6128 (which is of adamant) is fastened to the ends of the chains which
6129 extend to the middle of the column of light--this column is said to hold
6130 together the heaven; but whether it hangs from the spindle, or is at
6131 right angles to it, is not explained. The cylinder containing the orbits
6132 of the stars is almost as much a symbol as the figure of Necessity
6133 turning the spindle;--for the outermost rim is the sphere of the fixed
6134 stars, and nothing is said about the intervals of space which divide the
6135 paths of the stars in the heavens. The description is both a picture and
6136 an orrery, and therefore is necessarily inconsistent with itself. The
6137 column of light is not the Milky Way--which is neither straight, nor
6138 like a rainbow--but the imaginary axis of the earth. This is compared
6139 to the rainbow in respect not of form but of colour, and not to the
6140 undergirders of a trireme, but to the straight rope running from prow to
6141 stern in which the undergirders meet.
6142 
6143 The orrery or picture of the heavens given in the Republic differs in
6144 its mode of representation from the circles of the same and of the
6145 other in the Timaeus. In both the fixed stars are distinguished from the
6146 planets, and they move in orbits without them, although in an opposite
6147 direction: in the Republic as in the Timaeus they are all moving round
6148 the axis of the world. But we are not certain that in the former they
6149 are moving round the earth. No distinct mention is made in the Republic
6150 of the circles of the same and other; although both in the Timaeus and
6151 in the Republic the motion of the fixed stars is supposed to coincide
6152 with the motion of the whole. The relative thickness of the rims is
6153 perhaps designed to express the relative distances of the planets.
6154 Plato probably intended to represent the earth, from which Er and his
6155 companions are viewing the heavens, as stationary in place; but whether
6156 or not herself revolving, unless this is implied in the revolution of
6157 the axis, is uncertain (Timaeus). The spectator may be supposed to look
6158 at the heavenly bodies, either from above or below. The earth is a sort
6159 of earth and heaven in one, like the heaven of the Phaedrus, on the back
6160 of which the spectator goes out to take a peep at the stars and is borne
6161 round in the revolution. There is no distinction between the equator and
6162 the ecliptic. But Plato is no doubt led to imagine that the planets have
6163 an opposite motion to that of the fixed stars, in order to account for
6164 their appearances in the heavens. In the description of the meadow, and
6165 the retribution of the good and evil after death, there are traces of
6166 Homer.
6167 
6168 The description of the axis as a spindle, and of the heavenly bodies as
6169 forming a whole, partly arises out of the attempt to connect the motions
6170 of the heavenly bodies with the mythological image of the web, or
6171 weaving of the Fates. The giving of the lots, the weaving of them,
6172 and the making of them irreversible, which are ascribed to the three
6173 Fates--Lachesis, Clotho, Atropos, are obviously derived from their
6174 names. The element of chance in human life is indicated by the order of
6175 the lots. But chance, however adverse, may be overcome by the wisdom
6176 of man, if he knows how to choose aright; there is a worse enemy to man
6177 than chance; this enemy is himself. He who was moderately fortunate in
6178 the number of the lot--even the very last comer--might have a good life
6179 if he chose with wisdom. And as Plato does not like to make an assertion
6180 which is unproven, he more than confirms this statement a few sentences
6181 afterwards by the example of Odysseus, who chose last. But the virtue
6182 which is founded on habit is not sufficient to enable a man to choose;
6183 he must add to virtue knowledge, if he is to act rightly when placed
6184 in new circumstances. The routine of good actions and good habits is
6185 an inferior sort of goodness; and, as Coleridge says, 'Common sense
6186 is intolerable which is not based on metaphysics,' so Plato would have
6187 said, 'Habit is worthless which is not based upon philosophy.'
6188 
6189 The freedom of the will to refuse the evil and to choose the good is
6190 distinctly asserted. 'Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours
6191 her he will have more or less of her.' The life of man is 'rounded'
6192 by necessity; there are circumstances prior to birth which affect him
6193 (Pol.). But within the walls of necessity there is an open space in
6194 which he is his own master, and can study for himself the effects which
6195 the variously compounded gifts of nature or fortune have upon the soul,
6196 and act accordingly. All men cannot have the first choice in everything.
6197 But the lot of all men is good enough, if they choose wisely and will
6198 live diligently.
6199 
6200 The verisimilitude which is given to the pilgrimage of a thousand years,
6201 by the intimation that Ardiaeus had lived a thousand years before;
6202 the coincidence of Er coming to life on the twelfth day after he was
6203 supposed to have been dead with the seven days which the pilgrims passed
6204 in the meadow, and the four days during which they journeyed to the
6205 column of light; the precision with which the soul is mentioned who
6206 chose the twentieth lot; the passing remarks that there was no definite
6207 character among the souls, and that the souls which had chosen ill
6208 blamed any one rather than themselves; or that some of the souls drank
6209 more than was necessary of the waters of Forgetfulness, while Er himself
6210 was hindered from drinking; the desire of Odysseus to rest at last,
6211 unlike the conception of him in Dante and Tennyson; the feigned
6212 ignorance of how Er returned to the body, when the other souls went
6213 shooting like stars to their birth,--add greatly to the probability of
6214 the narrative. They are such touches of nature as the art of Defoe
6215 might have introduced when he wished to win credibility for marvels and
6216 apparitions.
6217 
6218 *****
6219 
6220 There still remain to be considered some points which have been
6221 intentionally reserved to the end: (1) the Janus-like character of the
6222 Republic, which presents two faces--one an Hellenic state, the other a
6223 kingdom of philosophers. Connected with the latter of the two aspects
6224 are (2) the paradoxes of the Republic, as they have been termed by
6225 Morgenstern: (a) the community of property; (b) of families; (c) the
6226 rule of philosophers; (d) the analogy of the individual and the State,
6227 which, like some other analogies in the Republic, is carried too far. We
6228 may then proceed to consider (3) the subject of education as conceived
6229 by Plato, bringing together in a general view the education of youth
6230 and the education of after-life; (4) we may note further some essential
6231 differences between ancient and modern politics which are suggested by
6232 the Republic; (5) we may compare the Politicus and the Laws; (6) we may
6233 observe the influence exercised by Plato on his imitators; and (7)
6234 take occasion to consider the nature and value of political, and (8) of
6235 religious ideals.
6236 
6237 1. Plato expressly says that he is intending to found an Hellenic State
6238 (Book V). Many of his regulations are characteristically Spartan; such
6239 as the prohibition of gold and silver, the common meals of the men, the
6240 military training of the youth, the gymnastic exercises of the women.
6241 The life of Sparta was the life of a camp (Laws), enforced even more
6242 rigidly in time of peace than in war; the citizens of Sparta, like
6243 Plato's, were forbidden to trade--they were to be soldiers and not
6244 shopkeepers. Nowhere else in Greece was the individual so completely
6245 subjected to the State; the time when he was to marry, the education of
6246 his children, the clothes which he was to wear, the food which he was
6247 to eat, were all prescribed by law. Some of the best enactments in the
6248 Republic, such as the reverence to be paid to parents and elders,
6249 and some of the worst, such as the exposure of deformed children, are
6250 borrowed from the practice of Sparta. The encouragement of friendships
6251 between men and youths, or of men with one another, as affording
6252 incentives to bravery, is also Spartan; in Sparta too a nearer approach
6253 was made than in any other Greek State to equality of the sexes, and
6254 to community of property; and while there was probably less of
6255 licentiousness in the sense of immorality, the tie of marriage was
6256 regarded more lightly than in the rest of Greece. The 'suprema lex'
6257 was the preservation of the family, and the interest of the State. The
6258 coarse strength of a military government was not favourable to purity
6259 and refinement; and the excessive strictness of some regulations seems
6260 to have produced a reaction. Of all Hellenes the Spartans were most
6261 accessible to bribery; several of the greatest of them might be
6262 described in the words of Plato as having a 'fierce secret longing
6263 after gold and silver.' Though not in the strict sense communists, the
6264 principle of communism was maintained among them in their division of
6265 lands, in their common meals, in their slaves, and in the free use of
6266 one another's goods. Marriage was a public institution: and the women
6267 were educated by the State, and sang and danced in public with the men.
6268 
6269 Many traditions were preserved at Sparta of the severity with which the
6270 magistrates had maintained the primitive rule of music and poetry; as in
6271 the Republic of Plato, the new-fangled poet was to be expelled. Hymns
6272 to the Gods, which are the only kind of music admitted into the ideal
6273 State, were the only kind which was permitted at Sparta. The Spartans,
6274 though an unpoetical race, were nevertheless lovers of poetry; they had
6275 been stirred by the Elegiac strains of Tyrtaeus, they had crowded around
6276 Hippias to hear his recitals of Homer; but in this they resembled the
6277 citizens of the timocratic rather than of the ideal State. The council
6278 of elder men also corresponds to the Spartan gerousia; and the freedom
6279 with which they are permitted to judge about matters of detail agrees
6280 with what we are told of that institution. Once more, the military rule
6281 of not spoiling the dead or offering arms at the temples; the moderation
6282 in the pursuit of enemies; the importance attached to the physical
6283 well-being of the citizens; the use of warfare for the sake of defence
6284 rather than of aggression--are features probably suggested by the spirit
6285 and practice of Sparta.
6286 
6287 To the Spartan type the ideal State reverts in the first decline; and
6288 the character of the individual timocrat is borrowed from the Spartan
6289 citizen. The love of Lacedaemon not only affected Plato and Xenophon,
6290 but was shared by many undistinguished Athenians; there they seemed to
6291 find a principle which was wanting in their own democracy. The (Greek)
6292 of the Spartans attracted them, that is to say, not the goodness
6293 of their laws, but the spirit of order and loyalty which prevailed.
6294 Fascinated by the idea, citizens of Athens would imitate the
6295 Lacedaemonians in their dress and manners; they were known to the
6296 contemporaries of Plato as 'the persons who had their ears bruised,'
6297 like the Roundheads of the Commonwealth. The love of another church
6298 or country when seen at a distance only, the longing for an imaginary
6299 simplicity in civilized times, the fond desire of a past which never has
6300 been, or of a future which never will be,--these are aspirations of the
6301 human mind which are often felt among ourselves. Such feelings meet with
6302 a response in the Republic of Plato.
6303 
6304 But there are other features of the Platonic Republic, as, for example,
6305 the literary and philosophical education, and the grace and beauty
6306 of life, which are the reverse of Spartan. Plato wishes to give his
6307 citizens a taste of Athenian freedom as well as of Lacedaemonian
6308 discipline. His individual genius is purely Athenian, although in theory
6309 he is a lover of Sparta; and he is something more than either--he has
6310 also a true Hellenic feeling. He is desirous of humanizing the wars of
6311 Hellenes against one another; he acknowledges that the Delphian God is
6312 the grand hereditary interpreter of all Hellas. The spirit of harmony
6313 and the Dorian mode are to prevail, and the whole State is to have an
6314 external beauty which is the reflex of the harmony within. But he
6315 has not yet found out the truth which he afterwards enunciated in the
6316 Laws--that he was a better legislator who made men to be of one mind,
6317 than he who trained them for war. The citizens, as in other Hellenic
6318 States, democratic as well as aristocratic, are really an upper class;
6319 for, although no mention is made of slaves, the lower classes are
6320 allowed to fade away into the distance, and are represented in the
6321 individual by the passions. Plato has no idea either of a social State
6322 in which all classes are harmonized, or of a federation of Hellas or
6323 the world in which different nations or States have a place. His city
6324 is equipped for war rather than for peace, and this would seem to be
6325 justified by the ordinary condition of Hellenic States. The myth of the
6326 earth-born men is an embodiment of the orthodox tradition of Hellas,
6327 and the allusion to the four ages of the world is also sanctioned by
6328 the authority of Hesiod and the poets. Thus we see that the Republic is
6329 partly founded on the ideal of the old Greek polis, partly on the actual
6330 circumstances of Hellas in that age. Plato, like the old painters,
6331 retains the traditional form, and like them he has also a vision of a
6332 city in the clouds.
6333 
6334 There is yet another thread which is interwoven in the texture of the
6335 work; for the Republic is not only a Dorian State, but a Pythagorean
6336 league. The 'way of life' which was connected with the name of
6337 Pythagoras, like the Catholic monastic orders, showed the power which
6338 the mind of an individual might exercise over his contemporaries, and
6339 may have naturally suggested to Plato the possibility of reviving such
6340 'mediaeval institutions.' The Pythagoreans, like Plato, enforced a rule
6341 of life and a moral and intellectual training. The influence ascribed to
6342 music, which to us seems exaggerated, is also a Pythagorean feature; it
6343 is not to be regarded as representing the real influence of music in
6344 the Greek world. More nearly than any other government of Hellas, the
6345 Pythagorean league of three hundred was an aristocracy of virtue. For
6346 once in the history of mankind the philosophy of order or (Greek),
6347 expressing and consequently enlisting on its side the combined
6348 endeavours of the better part of the people, obtained the management of
6349 public affairs and held possession of it for a considerable time (until
6350 about B.C. 500). Probably only in States prepared by Dorian institutions
6351 would such a league have been possible. The rulers, like Plato's
6352 (Greek), were required to submit to a severe training in order to
6353 prepare the way for the education of the other members of the community.
6354 Long after the dissolution of the Order, eminent Pythagoreans, such as
6355 Archytas of Tarentum, retained their political influence over the cities
6356 of Magna Graecia. There was much here that was suggestive to the kindred
6357 spirit of Plato, who had doubtless meditated deeply on the 'way of life
6358 of Pythagoras' (Rep.) and his followers. Slight traces of Pythagoreanism
6359 are to be found in the mystical number of the State, in the number which
6360 expresses the interval between the king and the tyrant, in the doctrine
6361 of transmigration, in the music of the spheres, as well as in the great
6362 though secondary importance ascribed to mathematics in education.
6363 
6364 But as in his philosophy, so also in the form of his State, he goes far
6365 beyond the old Pythagoreans. He attempts a task really impossible, which
6366 is to unite the past of Greek history with the future of philosophy,
6367 analogous to that other impossibility, which has often been the dream
6368 of Christendom, the attempt to unite the past history of Europe with
6369 the kingdom of Christ. Nothing actually existing in the world at all
6370 resembles Plato's ideal State; nor does he himself imagine that such
6371 a State is possible. This he repeats again and again; e.g. in the
6372 Republic, or in the Laws where, casting a glance back on the Republic,
6373 he admits that the perfect state of communism and philosophy was
6374 impossible in his own age, though still to be retained as a pattern.
6375 The same doubt is implied in the earnestness with which he argues in the
6376 Republic that ideals are none the worse because they cannot be realized
6377 in fact, and in the chorus of laughter, which like a breaking wave will,
6378 as he anticipates, greet the mention of his proposals; though like
6379 other writers of fiction, he uses all his art to give reality to his
6380 inventions. When asked how the ideal polity can come into being, he
6381 answers ironically, 'When one son of a king becomes a philosopher'; he
6382 designates the fiction of the earth-born men as 'a noble lie'; and when
6383 the structure is finally complete, he fairly tells you that his Republic
6384 is a vision only, which in some sense may have reality, but not in the
6385 vulgar one of a reign of philosophers upon earth. It has been said that
6386 Plato flies as well as walks, but this falls short of the truth; for he
6387 flies and walks at the same time, and is in the air and on firm ground
6388 in successive instants.
6389 
6390 Niebuhr has asked a trifling question, which may be briefly noticed in
6391 this place--Was Plato a good citizen? If by this is meant, Was he loyal
6392 to Athenian institutions?--he can hardly be said to be the friend of
6393 democracy: but neither is he the friend of any other existing form of
6394 government; all of them he regarded as 'states of faction' (Laws); none
6395 attained to his ideal of a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects, which
6396 seems indeed more nearly to describe democracy than any other; and the
6397 worst of them is tyranny. The truth is, that the question has hardly any
6398 meaning when applied to a great philosopher whose writings are not meant
6399 for a particular age and country, but for all time and all mankind. The
6400 decline of Athenian politics was probably the motive which led Plato to
6401 frame an ideal State, and the Republic may be regarded as reflecting the
6402 departing glory of Hellas. As well might we complain of St. Augustine,
6403 whose great work 'The City of God' originated in a similar motive, for
6404 not being loyal to the Roman Empire. Even a nearer parallel might be
6405 afforded by the first Christians, who cannot fairly be charged with
6406 being bad citizens because, though 'subject to the higher powers,' they
6407 were looking forward to a city which is in heaven.
6408 
6409 2. The idea of the perfect State is full of paradox when judged of
6410 according to the ordinary notions of mankind. The paradoxes of one age
6411 have been said to become the commonplaces of the next; but the
6412 paradoxes of Plato are at least as paradoxical to us as they were to his
6413 contemporaries. The modern world has either sneered at them as absurd,
6414 or denounced them as unnatural and immoral; men have been pleased to
6415 find in Aristotle's criticisms of them the anticipation of their own
6416 good sense. The wealthy and cultivated classes have disliked and also
6417 dreaded them; they have pointed with satisfaction to the failure of
6418 efforts to realize them in practice. Yet since they are the thoughts of
6419 one of the greatest of human intelligences, and of one who had done
6420 most to elevate morality and religion, they seem to deserve a better
6421 treatment at our hands. We may have to address the public, as Plato does
6422 poetry, and assure them that we mean no harm to existing institutions.
6423 There are serious errors which have a side of truth and which therefore
6424 may fairly demand a careful consideration: there are truths mixed with
6425 error of which we may indeed say, 'The half is better than the whole.'
6426 Yet 'the half' may be an important contribution to the study of human
6427 nature.
6428 
6429 (a) The first paradox is the community of goods, which is mentioned
6430 slightly at the end of the third Book, and seemingly, as Aristotle
6431 observes, is confined to the guardians; at least no mention is made of
6432 the other classes. But the omission is not of any real significance, and
6433 probably arises out of the plan of the work, which prevents the writer
6434 from entering into details.
6435 
6436 Aristotle censures the community of property much in the spirit of
6437 modern political economy, as tending to repress industry, and as doing
6438 away with the spirit of benevolence. Modern writers almost refuse to
6439 consider the subject, which is supposed to have been long ago settled
6440 by the common opinion of mankind. But it must be remembered that the
6441 sacredness of property is a notion far more fixed in modern than
6442 in ancient times. The world has grown older, and is therefore more
6443 conservative. Primitive society offered many examples of land held in
6444 common, either by a tribe or by a township, and such may probably
6445 have been the original form of landed tenure. Ancient legislators had
6446 invented various modes of dividing and preserving the divisions of land
6447 among the citizens; according to Aristotle there were nations who held
6448 the land in common and divided the produce, and there were others who
6449 divided the land and stored the produce in common. The evils of debt and
6450 the inequality of property were far greater in ancient than in modern
6451 times, and the accidents to which property was subject from war, or
6452 revolution, or taxation, or other legislative interference, were also
6453 greater. All these circumstances gave property a less fixed and sacred
6454 character. The early Christians are believed to have held their property
6455 in common, and the principle is sanctioned by the words of Christ
6456 himself, and has been maintained as a counsel of perfection in almost
6457 all ages of the Church. Nor have there been wanting instances of modern
6458 enthusiasts who have made a religion of communism; in every age of
6459 religious excitement notions like Wycliffe's 'inheritance of grace'
6460 have tended to prevail. A like spirit, but fiercer and more violent,
6461 has appeared in politics. 'The preparation of the Gospel of peace' soon
6462 becomes the red flag of Republicanism.
6463 
6464 We can hardly judge what effect Plato's views would have upon his
6465 own contemporaries; they would perhaps have seemed to them only an
6466 exaggeration of the Spartan commonwealth. Even modern writers would
6467 acknowledge that the right of private property is based on expediency,
6468 and may be interfered with in a variety of ways for the public good. Any
6469 other mode of vesting property which was found to be more advantageous,
6470 would in time acquire the same basis of right; 'the most useful,' in
6471 Plato's words, 'would be the most sacred.' The lawyers and ecclesiastics
6472 of former ages would have spoken of property as a sacred institution.
6473 But they only meant by such language to oppose the greatest amount
6474 of resistance to any invasion of the rights of individuals and of the
6475 Church.
6476 
6477 When we consider the question, without any fear of immediate application
6478 to practice, in the spirit of Plato's Republic, are we quite sure that
6479 the received notions of property are the best? Is the distribution of
6480 wealth which is customary in civilized countries the most favourable
6481 that can be conceived for the education and development of the mass
6482 of mankind? Can 'the spectator of all time and all existence' be quite
6483 convinced that one or two thousand years hence, great changes will not
6484 have taken place in the rights of property, or even that the very notion
6485 of property, beyond what is necessary for personal maintenance, may not
6486 have disappeared? This was a distinction familiar to Aristotle, though
6487 likely to be laughed at among ourselves. Such a change would not be
6488 greater than some other changes through which the world has passed
6489 in the transition from ancient to modern society, for example, the
6490 emancipation of the serfs in Russia, or the abolition of slavery in
6491 America and the West Indies; and not so great as the difference which
6492 separates the Eastern village community from the Western world. To
6493 accomplish such a revolution in the course of a few centuries, would
6494 imply a rate of progress not more rapid than has actually taken place
6495 during the last fifty or sixty years. The kingdom of Japan underwent
6496 more change in five or six years than Europe in five or six hundred.
6497 Many opinions and beliefs which have been cherished among ourselves
6498 quite as strongly as the sacredness of property have passed away; and
6499 the most untenable propositions respecting the right of bequests or
6500 entail have been maintained with as much fervour as the most moderate.
6501 Some one will be heard to ask whether a state of society can be final in
6502 which the interests of thousands are perilled on the life or character
6503 of a single person. And many will indulge the hope that our present
6504 condition may, after all, be only transitional, and may conduct to a
6505 higher, in which property, besides ministering to the enjoyment of the
6506 few, may also furnish the means of the highest culture to all, and will
6507 be a greater benefit to the public generally, and also more under the
6508 control of public authority. There may come a time when the saying,
6509 'Have I not a right to do what I will with my own?' will appear to be a
6510 barbarous relic of individualism;--when the possession of a part may be
6511 a greater blessing to each and all than the possession of the whole is
6512 now to any one.
6513 
6514 Such reflections appear visionary to the eye of the practical statesman,
6515 but they are within the range of possibility to the philosopher. He can
6516 imagine that in some distant age or clime, and through the influence of
6517 some individual, the notion of common property may or might have sunk
6518 as deep into the heart of a race, and have become as fixed to them, as
6519 private property is to ourselves. He knows that this latter institution
6520 is not more than four or five thousand years old: may not the end revert
6521 to the beginning? In our own age even Utopias affect the spirit of
6522 legislation, and an abstract idea may exercise a great influence on
6523 practical politics.
6524 
6525 The objections that would be generally urged against Plato's community
6526 of property, are the old ones of Aristotle, that motives for exertion
6527 would be taken away, and that disputes would arise when each was
6528 dependent upon all. Every man would produce as little and consume as
6529 much as he liked. The experience of civilized nations has hitherto been
6530 adverse to Socialism. The effort is too great for human nature; men try
6531 to live in common, but the personal feeling is always breaking in. On
6532 the other hand it may be doubted whether our present notions of property
6533 are not conventional, for they differ in different countries and in
6534 different states of society. We boast of an individualism which is not
6535 freedom, but rather an artificial result of the industrial state
6536 of modern Europe. The individual is nominally free, but he is also
6537 powerless in a world bound hand and foot in the chains of economic
6538 necessity. Even if we cannot expect the mass of mankind to become
6539 disinterested, at any rate we observe in them a power of organization
6540 which fifty years ago would never have been suspected. The same forces
6541 which have revolutionized the political system of Europe, may effect a
6542 similar change in the social and industrial relations of mankind. And if
6543 we suppose the influence of some good as well as neutral motives working
6544 in the community, there will be no absurdity in expecting that the
6545 mass of mankind having power, and becoming enlightened about the higher
6546 possibilities of human life, when they learn how much more is attainable
6547 for all than is at present the possession of a favoured few, may pursue
6548 the common interest with an intelligence and persistency which mankind
6549 have hitherto never seen.
6550 
6551 Now that the world has once been set in motion, and is no longer held
6552 fast under the tyranny of custom and ignorance; now that criticism has
6553 pierced the veil of tradition and the past no longer overpowers the
6554 present,--the progress of civilization may be expected to be far greater
6555 and swifter than heretofore. Even at our present rate of speed the point
6556 at which we may arrive in two or three generations is beyond the power
6557 of imagination to foresee. There are forces in the world which work, not
6558 in an arithmetical, but in a geometrical ratio of increase.
6559 Education, to use the expression of Plato, moves like a wheel with
6560 an ever-multiplying rapidity. Nor can we say how great may be its
6561 influence, when it becomes universal,--when it has been inherited by
6562 many generations,--when it is freed from the trammels of superstition
6563 and rightly adapted to the wants and capacities of different classes
6564 of men and women. Neither do we know how much more the co-operation of
6565 minds or of hands may be capable of accomplishing, whether in labour or
6566 in study. The resources of the natural sciences are not half-developed
6567 as yet; the soil of the earth, instead of growing more barren, may
6568 become many times more fertile than hitherto; the uses of machinery far
6569 greater, and also more minute than at present. New secrets of physiology
6570 may be revealed, deeply affecting human nature in its innermost
6571 recesses. The standard of health may be raised and the lives of men
6572 prolonged by sanitary and medical knowledge. There may be peace, there
6573 may be leisure, there may be innocent refreshments of many kinds. The
6574 ever-increasing power of locomotion may join the extremes of earth.
6575 There may be mysterious workings of the human mind, such as occur only
6576 at great crises of history. The East and the West may meet together, and
6577 all nations may contribute their thoughts and their experience to the
6578 common stock of humanity. Many other elements enter into a speculation
6579 of this kind. But it is better to make an end of them. For such
6580 reflections appear to the majority far-fetched, and to men of science,
6581 commonplace.
6582 
6583 (b) Neither to the mind of Plato nor of Aristotle did the doctrine of
6584 community of property present at all the same difficulty, or appear to
6585 be the same violation of the common Hellenic sentiment, as the community
6586 of wives and children. This paradox he prefaces by another proposal,
6587 that the occupations of men and women shall be the same, and that to
6588 this end they shall have a common training and education. Male and
6589 female animals have the same pursuits--why not also the two sexes of
6590 man?
6591 
6592 But have we not here fallen into a contradiction? for we were saying
6593 that different natures should have different pursuits. How then can men
6594 and women have the same? And is not the proposal inconsistent with our
6595 notion of the division of labour?--These objections are no sooner raised
6596 than answered; for, according to Plato, there is no organic difference
6597 between men and women, but only the accidental one that men beget and
6598 women bear children. Following the analogy of the other animals, he
6599 contends that all natural gifts are scattered about indifferently among
6600 both sexes, though there may be a superiority of degree on the part of
6601 the men. The objection on the score of decency to their taking part
6602 in the same gymnastic exercises, is met by Plato's assertion that the
6603 existing feeling is a matter of habit.
6604 
6605 That Plato should have emancipated himself from the ideas of his own
6606 country and from the example of the East, shows a wonderful independence
6607 of mind. He is conscious that women are half the human race, in some
6608 respects the more important half (Laws); and for the sake both of men
6609 and women he desires to raise the woman to a higher level of existence.
6610 He brings, not sentiment, but philosophy to bear upon a question which
6611 both in ancient and modern times has been chiefly regarded in the light
6612 of custom or feeling. The Greeks had noble conceptions of womanhood
6613 in the goddesses Athene and Artemis, and in the heroines Antigone and
6614 Andromache. But these ideals had no counterpart in actual life. The
6615 Athenian woman was in no way the equal of her husband; she was not the
6616 entertainer of his guests or the mistress of his house, but only his
6617 housekeeper and the mother of his children. She took no part in military
6618 or political matters; nor is there any instance in the later ages of
6619 Greece of a woman becoming famous in literature. 'Hers is the greatest
6620 glory who has the least renown among men,' is the historian's conception
6621 of feminine excellence. A very different ideal of womanhood is held up
6622 by Plato to the world; she is to be the companion of the man, and to
6623 share with him in the toils of war and in the cares of government. She
6624 is to be similarly trained both in bodily and mental exercises. She
6625 is to lose as far as possible the incidents of maternity and the
6626 characteristics of the female sex.
6627 
6628 The modern antagonist of the equality of the sexes would argue that the
6629 differences between men and women are not confined to the single point
6630 urged by Plato; that sensibility, gentleness, grace, are the qualities
6631 of women, while energy, strength, higher intelligence, are to be looked
6632 for in men. And the criticism is just: the differences affect the whole
6633 nature, and are not, as Plato supposes, confined to a single point. But
6634 neither can we say how far these differences are due to education and
6635 the opinions of mankind, or physically inherited from the habits and
6636 opinions of former generations. Women have been always taught, not
6637 exactly that they are slaves, but that they are in an inferior position,
6638 which is also supposed to have compensating advantages; and to this
6639 position they have conformed. It is also true that the physical form may
6640 easily change in the course of generations through the mode of life; and
6641 the weakness or delicacy, which was once a matter of opinion, may become
6642 a physical fact. The characteristics of sex vary greatly in different
6643 countries and ranks of society, and at different ages in the same
6644 individuals. Plato may have been right in denying that there was any
6645 ultimate difference in the sexes of man other than that which exists in
6646 animals, because all other differences may be conceived to disappear in
6647 other states of society, or under different circumstances of life and
6648 training.
6649 
6650 The first wave having been passed, we proceed to the second--community
6651 of wives and children. 'Is it possible? Is it desirable?' For as Glaucon
6652 intimates, and as we far more strongly insist, 'Great doubts may
6653 be entertained about both these points.' Any free discussion of the
6654 question is impossible, and mankind are perhaps right in not allowing
6655 the ultimate bases of social life to be examined. Few of us can safely
6656 enquire into the things which nature hides, any more than we can
6657 dissect our own bodies. Still, the manner in which Plato arrived at his
6658 conclusions should be considered. For here, as Mr. Grote has remarked,
6659 is a wonderful thing, that one of the wisest and best of men should have
6660 entertained ideas of morality which are wholly at variance with our
6661 own. And if we would do Plato justice, we must examine carefully the
6662 character of his proposals. First, we may observe that the relations of
6663 the sexes supposed by him are the reverse of licentious: he seems rather
6664 to aim at an impossible strictness. Secondly, he conceives the family
6665 to be the natural enemy of the state; and he entertains the serious
6666 hope that an universal brotherhood may take the place of private
6667 interests--an aspiration which, although not justified by experience,
6668 has possessed many noble minds. On the other hand, there is no sentiment
6669 or imagination in the connections which men and women are supposed by
6670 him to form; human beings return to the level of the animals, neither
6671 exalting to heaven, nor yet abusing the natural instincts. All that
6672 world of poetry and fancy which the passion of love has called forth
6673 in modern literature and romance would have been banished by Plato. The
6674 arrangements of marriage in the Republic are directed to one object--the
6675 improvement of the race. In successive generations a great development
6676 both of bodily and mental qualities might be possible. The analogy of
6677 animals tends to show that mankind can within certain limits receive a
6678 change of nature. And as in animals we should commonly choose the best
6679 for breeding, and destroy the others, so there must be a selection made
6680 of the human beings whose lives are worthy to be preserved.
6681 
6682 We start back horrified from this Platonic ideal, in the belief, first,
6683 that the higher feelings of humanity are far too strong to be crushed
6684 out; secondly, that if the plan could be carried into execution we
6685 should be poorly recompensed by improvements in the breed for the loss
6686 of the best things in life. The greatest regard for the weakest and
6687 meanest of human beings--the infant, the criminal, the insane, the
6688 idiot, truly seems to us one of the noblest results of Christianity. We
6689 have learned, though as yet imperfectly, that the individual man has an
6690 endless value in the sight of God, and that we honour Him when we honour
6691 the darkened and disfigured image of Him (Laws). This is the lesson
6692 which Christ taught in a parable when He said, 'Their angels do always
6693 behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.' Such lessons are only
6694 partially realized in any age; they were foreign to the age of Plato, as
6695 they have very different degrees of strength in different countries or
6696 ages of the Christian world. To the Greek the family was a religious and
6697 customary institution binding the members together by a tie inferior
6698 in strength to that of friendship, and having a less solemn and sacred
6699 sound than that of country. The relationship which existed on the lower
6700 level of custom, Plato imagined that he was raising to the higher level
6701 of nature and reason; while from the modern and Christian point of view
6702 we regard him as sanctioning murder and destroying the first principles
6703 of morality.
6704 
6705 The great error in these and similar speculations is that the difference
6706 between man and the animals is forgotten in them. The human being
6707 is regarded with the eye of a dog- or bird-fancier, or at best of a
6708 slave-owner; the higher or human qualities are left out. The breeder
6709 of animals aims chiefly at size or speed or strength; in a few cases at
6710 courage or temper; most often the fitness of the animal for food is the
6711 great desideratum. But mankind are not bred to be eaten, nor yet for
6712 their superiority in fighting or in running or in drawing carts. Neither
6713 does the improvement of the human race consist merely in the increase
6714 of the bones and flesh, but in the growth and enlightenment of the mind.
6715 Hence there must be 'a marriage of true minds' as well as of bodies, of
6716 imagination and reason as well as of lusts and instincts. Men and women
6717 without feeling or imagination are justly called brutes; yet Plato
6718 takes away these qualities and puts nothing in their place, not even
6719 the desire of a noble offspring, since parents are not to know their own
6720 children. The most important transaction of social life, he who is the
6721 idealist philosopher converts into the most brutal. For the pair are to
6722 have no relation to one another, except at the hymeneal festival; their
6723 children are not theirs, but the state's; nor is any tie of affection to
6724 unite them. Yet here the analogy of the animals might have saved
6725 Plato from a gigantic error, if he had 'not lost sight of his own
6726 illustration.' For the 'nobler sort of birds and beasts' nourish and
6727 protect their offspring and are faithful to one another.
6728 
6729 An eminent physiologist thinks it worth while 'to try and place life
6730 on a physical basis.' But should not life rest on the moral rather than
6731 upon the physical? The higher comes first, then the lower, first the
6732 human and rational, afterwards the animal. Yet they are not absolutely
6733 divided; and in times of sickness or moments of self-indulgence they
6734 seem to be only different aspects of a common human nature which
6735 includes them both. Neither is the moral the limit of the physical,
6736 but the expansion and enlargement of it,--the highest form which the
6737 physical is capable of receiving. As Plato would say, the body does not
6738 take care of the body, and still less of the mind, but the mind takes
6739 care of both. In all human action not that which is common to man and
6740 the animals is the characteristic element, but that which distinguishes
6741 him from them. Even if we admit the physical basis, and resolve all
6742 virtue into health of body 'la facon que notre sang circule,' still on
6743 merely physical grounds we must come back to ideas. Mind and reason and
6744 duty and conscience, under these or other names, are always reappearing.
6745 There cannot be health of body without health of mind; nor health of
6746 mind without the sense of duty and the love of truth (Charm).
6747 
6748 That the greatest of ancient philosophers should in his regulations
6749 about marriage have fallen into the error of separating body and mind,
6750 does indeed appear surprising. Yet the wonder is not so much that Plato
6751 should have entertained ideas of morality which to our own age are
6752 revolting, but that he should have contradicted himself to an extent
6753 which is hardly credible, falling in an instant from the heaven of
6754 idealism into the crudest animalism. Rejoicing in the newly found gift
6755 of reflection, he appears to have thought out a subject about which he
6756 had better have followed the enlightened feeling of his own age. The
6757 general sentiment of Hellas was opposed to his monstrous fancy. The old
6758 poets, and in later time the tragedians, showed no want of respect for
6759 the family, on which much of their religion was based. But the example
6760 of Sparta, and perhaps in some degree the tendency to defy public
6761 opinion, seems to have misled him. He will make one family out of all
6762 the families of the state. He will select the finest specimens of men
6763 and women and breed from these only.
6764 
6765 Yet because the illusion is always returning (for the animal part of
6766 human nature will from time to time assert itself in the disguise of
6767 philosophy as well as of poetry), and also because any departure from
6768 established morality, even where this is not intended, is apt to be
6769 unsettling, it may be worth while to draw out a little more at length
6770 the objections to the Platonic marriage. In the first place, history
6771 shows that wherever polygamy has been largely allowed the race has
6772 deteriorated. One man to one woman is the law of God and nature. Nearly
6773 all the civilized peoples of the world at some period before the age of
6774 written records, have become monogamists; and the step when once taken
6775 has never been retraced. The exceptions occurring among Brahmins or
6776 Mahometans or the ancient Persians, are of that sort which may be said
6777 to prove the rule. The connexions formed between superior and
6778 inferior races hardly ever produce a noble offspring, because they are
6779 licentious; and because the children in such cases usually despise the
6780 mother and are neglected by the father who is ashamed of them.
6781 Barbarous nations when they are introduced by Europeans to vice die
6782 out; polygamist peoples either import and adopt children from other
6783 countries, or dwindle in numbers, or both. Dynasties and aristocracies
6784 which have disregarded the laws of nature have decreased in numbers and
6785 degenerated in stature; 'mariages de convenance' leave their enfeebling
6786 stamp on the offspring of them (King Lear). The marriage of near
6787 relations, or the marrying in and in of the same family tends constantly
6788 to weakness or idiocy in the children, sometimes assuming the form as
6789 they grow older of passionate licentiousness. The common prostitute
6790 rarely has any offspring. By such unmistakable evidence is the authority
6791 of morality asserted in the relations of the sexes: and so many more
6792 elements enter into this 'mystery' than are dreamed of by Plato and some
6793 other philosophers.
6794 
6795 Recent enquirers have indeed arrived at the conclusion that among
6796 primitive tribes there existed a community of wives as of property, and
6797 that the captive taken by the spear was the only wife or slave whom any
6798 man was permitted to call his own. The partial existence of such customs
6799 among some of the lower races of man, and the survival of peculiar
6800 ceremonies in the marriages of some civilized nations, are thought to
6801 furnish a proof of similar institutions having been once universal.
6802 There can be no question that the study of anthropology has considerably
6803 changed our views respecting the first appearance of man upon the earth.
6804 We know more about the aborigines of the world than formerly, but our
6805 increasing knowledge shows above all things how little we know. With all
6806 the helps which written monuments afford, we do but faintly realize the
6807 condition of man two thousand or three thousand years ago. Of what his
6808 condition was when removed to a distance 200,000 or 300,000 years, when
6809 the majority of mankind were lower and nearer the animals than any tribe
6810 now existing upon the earth, we cannot even entertain conjecture. Plato
6811 (Laws) and Aristotle (Metaph.) may have been more right than we imagine
6812 in supposing that some forms of civilisation were discovered and lost
6813 several times over. If we cannot argue that all barbarism is a degraded
6814 civilization, neither can we set any limits to the depth of degradation
6815 to which the human race may sink through war, disease, or isolation.
6816 And if we are to draw inferences about the origin of marriage from
6817 the practice of barbarous nations, we should also consider the
6818 remoter analogy of the animals. Many birds and animals, especially the
6819 carnivorous, have only one mate, and the love and care of offspring
6820 which seems to be natural is inconsistent with the primitive theory of
6821 marriage. If we go back to an imaginary state in which men were almost
6822 animals and the companions of them, we have as much right to argue from
6823 what is animal to what is human as from the barbarous to the civilized
6824 man. The record of animal life on the globe is fragmentary,--the
6825 connecting links are wanting and cannot be supplied; the record of
6826 social life is still more fragmentary and precarious. Even if we admit
6827 that our first ancestors had no such institution as marriage, still
6828 the stages by which men passed from outer barbarism to the comparative
6829 civilization of China, Assyria, and Greece, or even of the ancient
6830 Germans, are wholly unknown to us.
6831 
6832 Such speculations are apt to be unsettling, because they seem to show
6833 that an institution which was thought to be a revelation from heaven, is
6834 only the growth of history and experience. We ask what is the origin of
6835 marriage, and we are told that like the right of property, after many
6836 wars and contests, it has gradually arisen out of the selfishness of
6837 barbarians. We stand face to face with human nature in its primitive
6838 nakedness. We are compelled to accept, not the highest, but the lowest
6839 account of the origin of human society. But on the other hand we
6840 may truly say that every step in human progress has been in the same
6841 direction, and that in the course of ages the idea of marriage and of
6842 the family has been more and more defined and consecrated. The civilized
6843 East is immeasurably in advance of any savage tribes; the Greeks and
6844 Romans have improved upon the East; the Christian nations have been
6845 stricter in their views of the marriage relation than any of the
6846 ancients. In this as in so many other things, instead of looking back
6847 with regret to the past, we should look forward with hope to the future.
6848 We must consecrate that which we believe to be the most holy, and that
6849 'which is the most holy will be the most useful.' There is more reason
6850 for maintaining the sacredness of the marriage tie, when we see the
6851 benefit of it, than when we only felt a vague religious horror about
6852 the violation of it. But in all times of transition, when established
6853 beliefs are being undermined, there is a danger that in the passage from
6854 the old to the new we may insensibly let go the moral principle, finding
6855 an excuse for listening to the voice of passion in the uncertainty of
6856 knowledge, or the fluctuations of opinion. And there are many persons
6857 in our own day who, enlightened by the study of anthropology, and
6858 fascinated by what is new and strange, some using the language of fear,
6859 others of hope, are inclined to believe that a time will come when
6860 through the self-assertion of women, or the rebellious spirit of
6861 children, by the analysis of human relations, or by the force of outward
6862 circumstances, the ties of family life may be broken or greatly relaxed.
6863 They point to societies in America and elsewhere which tend to show that
6864 the destruction of the family need not necessarily involve the overthrow
6865 of all morality. Wherever we may think of such speculations, we can
6866 hardly deny that they have been more rife in this generation than in any
6867 other; and whither they are tending, who can predict?
6868 
6869 To the doubts and queries raised by these 'social reformers' respecting
6870 the relation of the sexes and the moral nature of man, there is a
6871 sufficient answer, if any is needed. The difference about them and us is
6872 really one of fact. They are speaking of man as they wish or fancy him
6873 to be, but we are speaking of him as he is. They isolate the animal
6874 part of his nature; we regard him as a creature having many sides, or
6875 aspects, moving between good and evil, striving to rise above himself
6876 and to become 'a little lower than the angels.' We also, to use
6877 a Platonic formula, are not ignorant of the dissatisfactions and
6878 incompatibilities of family life, of the meannesses of trade, of the
6879 flatteries of one class of society by another, of the impediments which
6880 the family throws in the way of lofty aims and aspirations. But we are
6881 conscious that there are evils and dangers in the background greater
6882 still, which are not appreciated, because they are either concealed
6883 or suppressed. What a condition of man would that be, in which human
6884 passions were controlled by no authority, divine or human, in which
6885 there was no shame or decency, no higher affection overcoming or
6886 sanctifying the natural instincts, but simply a rule of health! Is it
6887 for this that we are asked to throw away the civilization which is the
6888 growth of ages?
6889 
6890 For strength and health are not the only qualities to be desired; there
6891 are the more important considerations of mind and character and soul. We
6892 know how human nature may be degraded; we do not know how by artificial
6893 means any improvement in the breed can be effected. The problem is a
6894 complex one, for if we go back only four steps (and these at least enter
6895 into the composition of a child), there are commonly thirty progenitors
6896 to be taken into account. Many curious facts, rarely admitting of proof,
6897 are told us respecting the inheritance of disease or character from a
6898 remote ancestor. We can trace the physical resemblances of parents and
6899 children in the same family--
6900 
6901 'Sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat';
6902 
6903 but scarcely less often the differences which distinguish children both
6904 from their parents and from one another. We are told of similar mental
6905 peculiarities running in families, and again of a tendency, as in
6906 the animals, to revert to a common or original stock. But we have a
6907 difficulty in distinguishing what is a true inheritance of genius or
6908 other qualities, and what is mere imitation or the result of similar
6909 circumstances. Great men and great women have rarely had great fathers
6910 and mothers. Nothing that we know of in the circumstances of their birth
6911 or lineage will explain their appearance. Of the English poets of the
6912 last and two preceding centuries scarcely a descendant remains,--none
6913 have ever been distinguished. So deeply has nature hidden her secret,
6914 and so ridiculous is the fancy which has been entertained by some that
6915 we might in time by suitable marriage arrangements or, as Plato would
6916 have said, 'by an ingenious system of lots,' produce a Shakespeare or
6917 a Milton. Even supposing that we could breed men having the tenacity
6918 of bulldogs, or, like the Spartans, 'lacking the wit to run away
6919 in battle,' would the world be any the better? Many of the noblest
6920 specimens of the human race have been among the weakest physically.
6921 Tyrtaeus or Aesop, or our own Newton, would have been exposed at Sparta;
6922 and some of the fairest and strongest men and women have been among the
6923 wickedest and worst. Not by the Platonic device of uniting the strong
6924 and fair with the strong and fair, regardless of sentiment and morality,
6925 nor yet by his other device of combining dissimilar natures (Statesman),
6926 have mankind gradually passed from the brutality and licentiousness of
6927 primitive marriage to marriage Christian and civilized.
6928 
6929 Few persons would deny that we bring into the world an inheritance of
6930 mental and physical qualities derived first from our parents, or through
6931 them from some remoter ancestor, secondly from our race, thirdly from
6932 the general condition of mankind into which we are born. Nothing is
6933 commoner than the remark, that 'So and so is like his father or his
6934 uncle'; and an aged person may not unfrequently note a resemblance in
6935 a youth to a long-forgotten ancestor, observing that 'Nature sometimes
6936 skips a generation.' It may be true also, that if we knew more about
6937 our ancestors, these similarities would be even more striking to us.
6938 Admitting the facts which are thus described in a popular way, we may
6939 however remark that there is no method of difference by which they can
6940 be defined or estimated, and that they constitute only a small part of
6941 each individual. The doctrine of heredity may seem to take out of our
6942 hands the conduct of our own lives, but it is the idea, not the fact,
6943 which is really terrible to us. For what we have received from our
6944 ancestors is only a fraction of what we are, or may become. The
6945 knowledge that drunkenness or insanity has been prevalent in a
6946 family may be the best safeguard against their recurrence in a future
6947 generation. The parent will be most awake to the vices or diseases in
6948 his child of which he is most sensible within himself. The whole of life
6949 may be directed to their prevention or cure. The traces of consumption
6950 may become fainter, or be wholly effaced: the inherent tendency to vice
6951 or crime may be eradicated. And so heredity, from being a curse, may
6952 become a blessing. We acknowledge that in the matter of our birth, as in
6953 our nature generally, there are previous circumstances which affect
6954 us. But upon this platform of circumstances or within this wall of
6955 necessity, we have still the power of creating a life for ourselves by
6956 the informing energy of the human will.
6957 
6958 There is another aspect of the marriage question to which Plato is a
6959 stranger. All the children born in his state are foundlings. It never
6960 occurred to him that the greater part of them, according to universal
6961 experience, would have perished. For children can only be brought up in
6962 families. There is a subtle sympathy between the mother and the child
6963 which cannot be supplied by other mothers, or by 'strong nurses one or
6964 more' (Laws). If Plato's 'pen' was as fatal as the Creches of Paris, or
6965 the foundling hospital of Dublin, more than nine-tenths of his children
6966 would have perished. There would have been no need to expose or put
6967 out of the way the weaklier children, for they would have died of
6968 themselves. So emphatically does nature protest against the destruction
6969 of the family.
6970 
6971 What Plato had heard or seen of Sparta was applied by him in a mistaken
6972 way to his ideal commonwealth. He probably observed that both the
6973 Spartan men and women were superior in form and strength to the other
6974 Greeks; and this superiority he was disposed to attribute to the laws
6975 and customs relating to marriage. He did not consider that the desire
6976 of a noble offspring was a passion among the Spartans, or that their
6977 physical superiority was to be attributed chiefly, not to their marriage
6978 customs, but to their temperance and training. He did not reflect that
6979 Sparta was great, not in consequence of the relaxation of morality, but
6980 in spite of it, by virtue of a political principle stronger far than
6981 existed in any other Grecian state. Least of all did he observe that
6982 Sparta did not really produce the finest specimens of the Greek
6983 race. The genius, the political inspiration of Athens, the love of
6984 liberty--all that has made Greece famous with posterity, were wanting
6985 among the Spartans. They had no Themistocles, or Pericles, or Aeschylus,
6986 or Sophocles, or Socrates, or Plato. The individual was not allowed to
6987 appear above the state; the laws were fixed, and he had no business to
6988 alter or reform them. Yet whence has the progress of cities and nations
6989 arisen, if not from remarkable individuals, coming into the world we
6990 know not how, and from causes over which we have no control?
6991 Something too much may have been said in modern times of the value of
6992 individuality. But we can hardly condemn too strongly a system which,
6993 instead of fostering the scattered seeds or sparks of genius and
6994 character, tends to smother and extinguish them.
6995 
6996 Still, while condemning Plato, we must acknowledge that neither
6997 Christianity, nor any other form of religion and society, has hitherto
6998 been able to cope with this most difficult of social problems, and that
6999 the side from which Plato regarded it is that from which we turn away.
7000 Population is the most untameable force in the political and social
7001 world. Do we not find, especially in large cities, that the greatest
7002 hindrance to the amelioration of the poor is their improvidence in
7003 marriage?--a small fault truly, if not involving endless consequences.
7004 There are whole countries too, such as India, or, nearer home, Ireland,
7005 in which a right solution of the marriage question seems to lie at the
7006 foundation of the happiness of the community. There are too many people
7007 on a given space, or they marry too early and bring into the world a
7008 sickly and half-developed offspring; or owing to the very conditions
7009 of their existence, they become emaciated and hand on a similar life
7010 to their descendants. But who can oppose the voice of prudence to the
7011 'mightiest passions of mankind' (Laws), especially when they have
7012 been licensed by custom and religion? In addition to the influences of
7013 education, we seem to require some new principles of right and wrong in
7014 these matters, some force of opinion, which may indeed be already heard
7015 whispering in private, but has never affected the moral sentiments
7016 of mankind in general. We unavoidably lose sight of the principle of
7017 utility, just in that action of our lives in which we have the most need
7018 of it. The influences which we can bring to bear upon this question
7019 are chiefly indirect. In a generation or two, education, emigration,
7020 improvements in agriculture and manufactures, may have provided the
7021 solution. The state physician hardly likes to probe the wound: it is
7022 beyond his art; a matter which he cannot safely let alone, but which he
7023 dare not touch:
7024 
7025 'We do but skin and film the ulcerous place.'
7026 
7027 When again in private life we see a whole family one by one dropping
7028 into the grave under the Ate of some inherited malady, and the parents
7029 perhaps surviving them, do our minds ever go back silently to that day
7030 twenty-five or thirty years before on which under the fairest auspices,
7031 amid the rejoicings of friends and acquaintances, a bride and bridegroom
7032 joined hands with one another? In making such a reflection we are not
7033 opposing physical considerations to moral, but moral to physical; we are
7034 seeking to make the voice of reason heard, which drives us back from the
7035 extravagance of sentimentalism on common sense. The late Dr. Combe is
7036 said by his biographer to have resisted the temptation to marriage,
7037 because he knew that he was subject to hereditary consumption. One who
7038 deserved to be called a man of genius, a friend of my youth, was in the
7039 habit of wearing a black ribbon on his wrist, in order to remind him
7040 that, being liable to outbreaks of insanity, he must not give way to the
7041 natural impulses of affection: he died unmarried in a lunatic asylum.
7042 These two little facts suggest the reflection that a very few persons
7043 have done from a sense of duty what the rest of mankind ought to have
7044 done under like circumstances, if they had allowed themselves to think
7045 of all the misery which they were about to bring into the world. If
7046 we could prevent such marriages without any violation of feeling or
7047 propriety, we clearly ought; and the prohibition in the course of time
7048 would be protected by a 'horror naturalis' similar to that which, in
7049 all civilized ages and countries, has prevented the marriage of near
7050 relations by blood. Mankind would have been the happier, if some things
7051 which are now allowed had from the beginning been denied to them; if the
7052 sanction of religion could have prohibited practices inimical to health;
7053 if sanitary principles could in early ages have been invested with a
7054 superstitious awe. But, living as we do far on in the world's history,
7055 we are no longer able to stamp at once with the impress of religion a
7056 new prohibition. A free agent cannot have his fancies regulated by law;
7057 and the execution of the law would be rendered impossible, owing to the
7058 uncertainty of the cases in which marriage was to be forbidden. Who
7059 can weigh virtue, or even fortune against health, or moral and mental
7060 qualities against bodily? Who can measure probabilities against
7061 certainties? There has been some good as well as evil in the discipline
7062 of suffering; and there are diseases, such as consumption, which have
7063 exercised a refining and softening influence on the character. Youth is
7064 too inexperienced to balance such nice considerations; parents do not
7065 often think of them, or think of them too late. They are at a distance
7066 and may probably be averted; change of place, a new state of life, the
7067 interests of a home may be the cure of them. So persons vainly reason
7068 when their minds are already made up and their fortunes irrevocably
7069 linked together. Nor is there any ground for supposing that marriages
7070 are to any great extent influenced by reflections of this sort, which
7071 seem unable to make any head against the irresistible impulse of
7072 individual attachment.
7073 
7074 Lastly, no one can have observed the first rising flood of the passions
7075 in youth, the difficulty of regulating them, and the effects on the
7076 whole mind and nature which follow from them, the stimulus which
7077 is given to them by the imagination, without feeling that there is
7078 something unsatisfactory in our method of treating them. That the most
7079 important influence on human life should be wholly left to chance or
7080 shrouded in mystery, and instead of being disciplined or understood,
7081 should be required to conform only to an external standard of
7082 propriety--cannot be regarded by the philosopher as a safe or
7083 satisfactory condition of human things. And still those who have the
7084 charge of youth may find a way by watchfulness, by affection, by the
7085 manliness and innocence of their own lives, by occasional hints, by
7086 general admonitions which every one can apply for himself, to mitigate
7087 this terrible evil which eats out the heart of individuals and corrupts
7088 the moral sentiments of nations. In no duty towards others is there more
7089 need of reticence and self-restraint. So great is the danger lest he who
7090 would be the counsellor of another should reveal the secret prematurely,
7091 lest he should get another too much into his power; or fix the passing
7092 impression of evil by demanding the confession of it.
7093 
7094 Nor is Plato wrong in asserting that family attachments may interfere
7095 with higher aims. If there have been some who 'to party gave up what was
7096 meant for mankind,' there have certainly been others who to family
7097 gave up what was meant for mankind or for their country. The cares
7098 of children, the necessity of procuring money for their support, the
7099 flatteries of the rich by the poor, the exclusiveness of caste, the
7100 pride of birth or wealth, the tendency of family life to divert men from
7101 the pursuit of the ideal or the heroic, are as lowering in our own age
7102 as in that of Plato. And if we prefer to look at the gentle influences
7103 of home, the development of the affections, the amenities of society,
7104 the devotion of one member of a family for the good of the others, which
7105 form one side of the picture, we must not quarrel with him, or perhaps
7106 ought rather to be grateful to him, for having presented to us the
7107 reverse. Without attempting to defend Plato on grounds of morality, we
7108 may allow that there is an aspect of the world which has not unnaturally
7109 led him into error.
7110 
7111 We hardly appreciate the power which the idea of the State, like all
7112 other abstract ideas, exercised over the mind of Plato. To us the State
7113 seems to be built up out of the family, or sometimes to be the framework
7114 in which family and social life is contained. But to Plato in his
7115 present mood of mind the family is only a disturbing influence which,
7116 instead of filling up, tends to disarrange the higher unity of the
7117 State. No organization is needed except a political, which,
7118 regarded from another point of view, is a military one. The State is
7119 all-sufficing for the wants of man, and, like the idea of the Church in
7120 later ages, absorbs all other desires and affections. In time of war the
7121 thousand citizens are to stand like a rampart impregnable against the
7122 world or the Persian host; in time of peace the preparation for war and
7123 their duties to the State, which are also their duties to one another,
7124 take up their whole life and time. The only other interest which is
7125 allowed to them besides that of war, is the interest of philosophy. When
7126 they are too old to be soldiers they are to retire from active life
7127 and to have a second novitiate of study and contemplation. There is an
7128 element of monasticism even in Plato's communism. If he could have done
7129 without children, he might have converted his Republic into a religious
7130 order. Neither in the Laws, when the daylight of common sense breaks in
7131 upon him, does he retract his error. In the state of which he would be
7132 the founder, there is no marrying or giving in marriage: but because of
7133 the infirmity of mankind, he condescends to allow the law of nature to
7134 prevail.
7135 
7136 (c) But Plato has an equal, or, in his own estimation, even greater
7137 paradox in reserve, which is summed up in the famous text, 'Until kings
7138 are philosophers or philosophers are kings, cities will never cease
7139 from ill.' And by philosophers he explains himself to mean those who
7140 are capable of apprehending ideas, especially the idea of good. To the
7141 attainment of this higher knowledge the second education is directed.
7142 Through a process of training which has already made them good citizens
7143 they are now to be made good legislators. We find with some surprise
7144 (not unlike the feeling which Aristotle in a well-known passage
7145 describes the hearers of Plato's lectures as experiencing, when they
7146 went to a discourse on the idea of good, expecting to be instructed in
7147 moral truths, and received instead of them arithmetical and mathematical
7148 formulae) that Plato does not propose for his future legislators any
7149 study of finance or law or military tactics, but only of abstract
7150 mathematics, as a preparation for the still more abstract conception of
7151 good. We ask, with Aristotle, What is the use of a man knowing the idea
7152 of good, if he does not know what is good for this individual, this
7153 state, this condition of society? We cannot understand how Plato's
7154 legislators or guardians are to be fitted for their work of statesmen by
7155 the study of the five mathematical sciences. We vainly search in Plato's
7156 own writings for any explanation of this seeming absurdity.
7157 
7158 The discovery of a great metaphysical conception seems to ravish the
7159 mind with a prophetic consciousness which takes away the power
7160 of estimating its value. No metaphysical enquirer has ever fairly
7161 criticised his own speculations; in his own judgment they have been
7162 above criticism; nor has he understood that what to him seemed to be
7163 absolute truth may reappear in the next generation as a form of logic
7164 or an instrument of thought. And posterity have also sometimes equally
7165 misapprehended the real value of his speculations. They appear to them
7166 to have contributed nothing to the stock of human knowledge. The IDEA
7167 of good is apt to be regarded by the modern thinker as an unmeaning
7168 abstraction; but he forgets that this abstraction is waiting ready for
7169 use, and will hereafter be filled up by the divisions of knowledge.
7170 When mankind do not as yet know that the world is subject to law, the
7171 introduction of the mere conception of law or design or final cause, and
7172 the far-off anticipation of the harmony of knowledge, are great steps
7173 onward. Even the crude generalization of the unity of all things leads
7174 men to view the world with different eyes, and may easily affect their
7175 conception of human life and of politics, and also their own conduct and
7176 character (Tim). We can imagine how a great mind like that of Pericles
7177 might derive elevation from his intercourse with Anaxagoras (Phaedr.).
7178 To be struggling towards a higher but unattainable conception is a more
7179 favourable intellectual condition than to rest satisfied in a narrow
7180 portion of ascertained fact. And the earlier, which have sometimes been
7181 the greater ideas of science, are often lost sight of at a later period.
7182 How rarely can we say of any modern enquirer in the magnificent language
7183 of Plato, that 'He is the spectator of all time and of all existence!'
7184 
7185 Nor is there anything unnatural in the hasty application of these vast
7186 metaphysical conceptions to practical and political life. In the first
7187 enthusiasm of ideas men are apt to see them everywhere, and to apply
7188 them in the most remote sphere. They do not understand that the
7189 experience of ages is required to enable them to fill up 'the
7190 intermediate axioms.' Plato himself seems to have imagined that the
7191 truths of psychology, like those of astronomy and harmonics, would be
7192 arrived at by a process of deduction, and that the method which he has
7193 pursued in the Fourth Book, of inferring them from experience and the
7194 use of language, was imperfect and only provisional. But when, after
7195 having arrived at the idea of good, which is the end of the science of
7196 dialectic, he is asked, What is the nature, and what are the divisions
7197 of the science? He refuses to answer, as if intending by the refusal to
7198 intimate that the state of knowledge which then existed was not such as
7199 would allow the philosopher to enter into his final rest. The previous
7200 sciences must first be studied, and will, we may add, continue to be
7201 studied tell the end of time, although in a sense different from any
7202 which Plato could have conceived. But we may observe, that while he is
7203 aware of the vacancy of his own ideal, he is full of enthusiasm in the
7204 contemplation of it. Looking into the orb of light, he sees nothing, but
7205 he is warmed and elevated. The Hebrew prophet believed that faith in
7206 God would enable him to govern the world; the Greek philosopher imagined
7207 that contemplation of the good would make a legislator. There is as much
7208 to be filled up in the one case as in the other, and the one mode of
7209 conception is to the Israelite what the other is to the Greek. Both find
7210 a repose in a divine perfection, which, whether in a more personal or
7211 impersonal form, exists without them and independently of them, as well
7212 as within them.
7213 
7214 There is no mention of the idea of good in the Timaeus, nor of the
7215 divine Creator of the world in the Republic; and we are naturally led
7216 to ask in what relation they stand to one another. Is God above or below
7217 the idea of good? Or is the Idea of Good another mode of conceiving God?
7218 The latter appears to be the truer answer. To the Greek philosopher
7219 the perfection and unity of God was a far higher conception than his
7220 personality, which he hardly found a word to express, and which to him
7221 would have seemed to be borrowed from mythology. To the Christian, on
7222 the other hand, or to the modern thinker in general, it is difficult,
7223 if not impossible, to attach reality to what he terms mere abstraction;
7224 while to Plato this very abstraction is the truest and most real of all
7225 things. Hence, from a difference in forms of thought, Plato appears to
7226 be resting on a creation of his own mind only. But if we may be allowed
7227 to paraphrase the idea of good by the words 'intelligent principle of
7228 law and order in the universe, embracing equally man and nature,' we
7229 begin to find a meeting-point between him and ourselves.
7230 
7231 The question whether the ruler or statesman should be a philosopher is
7232 one that has not lost interest in modern times. In most countries of
7233 Europe and Asia there has been some one in the course of ages who
7234 has truly united the power of command with the power of thought and
7235 reflection, as there have been also many false combinations of these
7236 qualities. Some kind of speculative power is necessary both in practical
7237 and political life; like the rhetorician in the Phaedrus, men require to
7238 have a conception of the varieties of human character, and to be raised
7239 on great occasions above the commonplaces of ordinary life. Yet the idea
7240 of the philosopher-statesman has never been popular with the mass of
7241 mankind; partly because he cannot take the world into his confidence or
7242 make them understand the motives from which he acts; and also because
7243 they are jealous of a power which they do not understand. The revolution
7244 which human nature desires to effect step by step in many ages is likely
7245 to be precipitated by him in a single year or life. They are afraid that
7246 in the pursuit of his greater aims he may disregard the common feelings
7247 of humanity, he is too apt to be looking into the distant future or back
7248 into the remote past, and unable to see actions or events which, to use
7249 an expression of Plato's 'are tumbling out at his feet.' Besides, as
7250 Plato would say, there are other corruptions of these philosophical
7251 statesmen. Either 'the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with
7252 the pale cast of thought,' and at the moment when action above all
7253 things is required he is undecided, or general principles are enunciated
7254 by him in order to cover some change of policy; or his ignorance of the
7255 world has made him more easily fall a prey to the arts of others; or in
7256 some cases he has been converted into a courtier, who enjoys the luxury
7257 of holding liberal opinions, but was never known to perform a liberal
7258 action. No wonder that mankind have been in the habit of calling
7259 statesmen of this class pedants, sophisters, doctrinaires, visionaries.
7260 For, as we may be allowed to say, a little parodying the words of Plato,
7261 'they have seen bad imitations of the philosopher-statesman.' But a man
7262 in whom the power of thought and action are perfectly balanced, equal to
7263 the present, reaching forward to the future, 'such a one,' ruling in a
7264 constitutional state, 'they have never seen.'
7265 
7266 But as the philosopher is apt to fail in the routine of political life,
7267 so the ordinary statesman is also apt to fail in extraordinary crises.
7268 When the face of the world is beginning to alter, and thunder is heard
7269 in the distance, he is still guided by his old maxims, and is the slave
7270 of his inveterate party prejudices; he cannot perceive the signs of the
7271 times; instead of looking forward he looks back; he learns nothing and
7272 forgets nothing; with 'wise saws and modern instances' he would stem the
7273 rising tide of revolution. He lives more and more within the circle of
7274 his own party, as the world without him becomes stronger. This seems to
7275 be the reason why the old order of things makes so poor a figure
7276 when confronted with the new, why churches can never reform, why most
7277 political changes are made blindly and convulsively. The great crises
7278 in the history of nations have often been met by an ecclesiastical
7279 positiveness, and a more obstinate reassertion of principles which
7280 have lost their hold upon a nation. The fixed ideas of a reactionary
7281 statesman may be compared to madness; they grow upon him, and he becomes
7282 possessed by them; no judgement of others is ever admitted by him to be
7283 weighed in the balance against his own.
7284 
7285 (d) Plato, labouring under what, to modern readers, appears to have been
7286 a confusion of ideas, assimilates the state to the individual, and fails
7287 to distinguish Ethics from Politics. He thinks that to be most of a
7288 state which is most like one man, and in which the citizens have the
7289 greatest uniformity of character. He does not see that the analogy is
7290 partly fallacious, and that the will or character of a state or nation
7291 is really the balance or rather the surplus of individual wills, which
7292 are limited by the condition of having to act in common. The movement
7293 of a body of men can never have the pliancy or facility of a single man;
7294 the freedom of the individual, which is always limited, becomes still
7295 more straitened when transferred to a nation. The powers of action and
7296 feeling are necessarily weaker and more balanced when they are diffused
7297 through a community; whence arises the often discussed question, 'Can a
7298 nation, like an individual, have a conscience?' We hesitate to say
7299 that the characters of nations are nothing more than the sum of the
7300 characters of the individuals who compose them; because there may be
7301 tendencies in individuals which react upon one another. A whole nation
7302 may be wiser than any one man in it; or may be animated by some common
7303 opinion or feeling which could not equally have affected the mind of
7304 a single person, or may have been inspired by a leader of genius to
7305 perform acts more than human. Plato does not appear to have analysed
7306 the complications which arise out of the collective action of mankind.
7307 Neither is he capable of seeing that analogies, though specious as
7308 arguments, may often have no foundation in fact, or of distinguishing
7309 between what is intelligible or vividly present to the mind, and what
7310 is true. In this respect he is far below Aristotle, who is comparatively
7311 seldom imposed upon by false analogies. He cannot disentangle the arts
7312 from the virtues--at least he is always arguing from one to the other.
7313 His notion of music is transferred from harmony of sounds to harmony of
7314 life: in this he is assisted by the ambiguities of language as well as
7315 by the prevalence of Pythagorean notions. And having once assimilated
7316 the state to the individual, he imagines that he will find the
7317 succession of states paralleled in the lives of individuals.
7318 
7319 Still, through this fallacious medium, a real enlargement of ideas is
7320 attained. When the virtues as yet presented no distinct conception to
7321 the mind, a great advance was made by the comparison of them with the
7322 arts; for virtue is partly art, and has an outward form as well as an
7323 inward principle. The harmony of music affords a lively image of the
7324 harmonies of the world and of human life, and may be regarded as a
7325 splendid illustration which was naturally mistaken for a real analogy.
7326 In the same way the identification of ethics with politics has a
7327 tendency to give definiteness to ethics, and also to elevate and ennoble
7328 men's notions of the aims of government and of the duties of citizens;
7329 for ethics from one point of view may be conceived as an idealized law
7330 and politics; and politics, as ethics reduced to the conditions of human
7331 society. There have been evils which have arisen out of the attempt to
7332 identify them, and this has led to the separation or antagonism of
7333 them, which has been introduced by modern political writers. But we may
7334 likewise feel that something has been lost in their separation, and
7335 that the ancient philosophers who estimated the moral and intellectual
7336 wellbeing of mankind first, and the wealth of nations and individuals
7337 second, may have a salutary influence on the speculations of modern
7338 times. Many political maxims originate in a reaction against an opposite
7339 error; and when the errors against which they were directed have passed
7340 away, they in turn become errors.
7341 
7342 3. Plato's views of education are in several respects remarkable;
7343 like the rest of the Republic they are partly Greek and partly ideal,
7344 beginning with the ordinary curriculum of the Greek youth, and extending
7345 to after-life. Plato is the first writer who distinctly says that
7346 education is to comprehend the whole of life, and to be a preparation
7347 for another in which education begins again. This is the continuous
7348 thread which runs through the Republic, and which more than any other of
7349 his ideas admits of an application to modern life.
7350 
7351 He has long given up the notion that virtue cannot be taught; and he is
7352 disposed to modify the thesis of the Protagoras, that the virtues are
7353 one and not many. He is not unwilling to admit the sensible world
7354 into his scheme of truth. Nor does he assert in the Republic the
7355 involuntariness of vice, which is maintained by him in the Timaeus,
7356 Sophist, and Laws (Protag., Apol., Gorg.). Nor do the so-called Platonic
7357 ideas recovered from a former state of existence affect his theory
7358 of mental improvement. Still we observe in him the remains of the old
7359 Socratic doctrine, that true knowledge must be elicited from within, and
7360 is to be sought for in ideas, not in particulars of sense. Education, as
7361 he says, will implant a principle of intelligence which is better than
7362 ten thousand eyes. The paradox that the virtues are one, and the kindred
7363 notion that all virtue is knowledge, are not entirely renounced; the
7364 first is seen in the supremacy given to justice over the rest; the
7365 second in the tendency to absorb the moral virtues in the intellectual,
7366 and to centre all goodness in the contemplation of the idea of good. The
7367 world of sense is still depreciated and identified with opinion, though
7368 admitted to be a shadow of the true. In the Republic he is evidently
7369 impressed with the conviction that vice arises chiefly from ignorance
7370 and may be cured by education; the multitude are hardly to be deemed
7371 responsible for what they do. A faint allusion to the doctrine of
7372 reminiscence occurs in the Tenth Book; but Plato's views of education
7373 have no more real connection with a previous state of existence than
7374 our own; he only proposes to elicit from the mind that which is there
7375 already. Education is represented by him, not as the filling of a
7376 vessel, but as the turning the eye of the soul towards the light.
7377 
7378 He treats first of music or literature, which he divides into true and
7379 false, and then goes on to gymnastics; of infancy in the Republic he
7380 takes no notice, though in the Laws he gives sage counsels about the
7381 nursing of children and the management of the mothers, and would have
7382 an education which is even prior to birth. But in the Republic he begins
7383 with the age at which the child is capable of receiving ideas, and
7384 boldly asserts, in language which sounds paradoxical to modern ears,
7385 that he must be taught the false before he can learn the true. The
7386 modern and ancient philosophical world are not agreed about truth and
7387 falsehood; the one identifies truth almost exclusively with fact, the
7388 other with ideas. This is the difference between ourselves and Plato,
7389 which is, however, partly a difference of words. For we too should admit
7390 that a child must receive many lessons which he imperfectly understands;
7391 he must be taught some things in a figure only, some too which he can
7392 hardly be expected to believe when he grows older; but we should limit
7393 the use of fiction by the necessity of the case. Plato would draw the
7394 line differently; according to him the aim of early education is not
7395 truth as a matter of fact, but truth as a matter of principle; the child
7396 is to be taught first simple religious truths, and then simple moral
7397 truths, and insensibly to learn the lesson of good manners and good
7398 taste. He would make an entire reformation of the old mythology; like
7399 Xenophanes and Heracleitus he is sensible of the deep chasm which
7400 separates his own age from Homer and Hesiod, whom he quotes and invests
7401 with an imaginary authority, but only for his own purposes. The lusts
7402 and treacheries of the gods are to be banished; the terrors of the world
7403 below are to be dispelled; the misbehaviour of the Homeric heroes is
7404 not to be a model for youth. But there is another strain heard in Homer
7405 which may teach our youth endurance; and something may be learnt in
7406 medicine from the simple practice of the Homeric age. The principles
7407 on which religion is to be based are two only: first, that God is true;
7408 secondly, that he is good. Modern and Christian writers have often
7409 fallen short of these; they can hardly be said to have gone beyond them.
7410 
7411 The young are to be brought up in happy surroundings, out of the way of
7412 sights or sounds which may hurt the character or vitiate the taste.
7413 They are to live in an atmosphere of health; the breeze is always to
7414 be wafting to them the impressions of truth and goodness. Could such
7415 an education be realized, or if our modern religious education could
7416 be bound up with truth and virtue and good manners and good taste, that
7417 would be the best hope of human improvement. Plato, like ourselves,
7418 is looking forward to changes in the moral and religious world, and is
7419 preparing for them. He recognizes the danger of unsettling young men's
7420 minds by sudden changes of laws and principles, by destroying the
7421 sacredness of one set of ideas when there is nothing else to take their
7422 place. He is afraid too of the influence of the drama, on the ground
7423 that it encourages false sentiment, and therefore he would not have
7424 his children taken to the theatre; he thinks that the effect on the
7425 spectators is bad, and on the actors still worse. His idea of education
7426 is that of harmonious growth, in which are insensibly learnt the lessons
7427 of temperance and endurance, and the body and mind develope in equal
7428 proportions. The first principle which runs through all art and nature
7429 is simplicity; this also is to be the rule of human life.
7430 
7431 The second stage of education is gymnastic, which answers to the period
7432 of muscular growth and development. The simplicity which is enforced in
7433 music is extended to gymnastic; Plato is aware that the training of the
7434 body may be inconsistent with the training of the mind, and that bodily
7435 exercise may be easily overdone. Excessive training of the body is
7436 apt to give men a headache or to render them sleepy at a lecture on
7437 philosophy, and this they attribute not to the true cause, but to the
7438 nature of the subject. Two points are noticeable in Plato's treatment of
7439 gymnastic:--First, that the time of training is entirely separated from
7440 the time of literary education. He seems to have thought that two things
7441 of an opposite and different nature could not be learnt at the same
7442 time. Here we can hardly agree with him; and, if we may judge by
7443 experience, the effect of spending three years between the ages of
7444 fourteen and seventeen in mere bodily exercise would be far from
7445 improving to the intellect. Secondly, he affirms that music and
7446 gymnastic are not, as common opinion is apt to imagine, intended, the
7447 one for the cultivation of the mind and the other of the body, but that
7448 they are both equally designed for the improvement of the mind. The
7449 body, in his view, is the servant of the mind; the subjection of the
7450 lower to the higher is for the advantage of both. And doubtless the
7451 mind may exercise a very great and paramount influence over the body,
7452 if exerted not at particular moments and by fits and starts, but
7453 continuously, in making preparation for the whole of life. Other Greek
7454 writers saw the mischievous tendency of Spartan discipline (Arist. Pol;
7455 Thuc.). But only Plato recognized the fundamental error on which the
7456 practice was based.
7457 
7458 The subject of gymnastic leads Plato to the sister subject of medicine,
7459 which he further illustrates by the parallel of law. The modern
7460 disbelief in medicine has led in this, as in some other departments of
7461 knowledge, to a demand for greater simplicity; physicians are becoming
7462 aware that they often make diseases 'greater and more complicated' by
7463 their treatment of them (Rep.). In two thousand years their art has made
7464 but slender progress; what they have gained in the analysis of the parts
7465 is in a great degree lost by their feebler conception of the human frame
7466 as a whole. They have attended more to the cure of diseases than to the
7467 conditions of health; and the improvements in medicine have been more
7468 than counterbalanced by the disuse of regular training. Until lately
7469 they have hardly thought of air and water, the importance of which was
7470 well understood by the ancients; as Aristotle remarks, 'Air and water,
7471 being the elements which we most use, have the greatest effect upon
7472 health' (Polit.). For ages physicians have been under the dominion of
7473 prejudices which have only recently given way; and now there are as many
7474 opinions in medicine as in theology, and an equal degree of scepticism
7475 and some want of toleration about both. Plato has several good notions
7476 about medicine; according to him, 'the eye cannot be cured without the
7477 rest of the body, nor the body without the mind' (Charm.). No man
7478 of sense, he says in the Timaeus, would take physic; and we heartily
7479 sympathize with him in the Laws when he declares that 'the limbs of the
7480 rustic worn with toil will derive more benefit from warm baths than from
7481 the prescriptions of a not over wise doctor.' But we can hardly praise
7482 him when, in obedience to the authority of Homer, he depreciates diet,
7483 or approve of the inhuman spirit in which he would get rid of invalid
7484 and useless lives by leaving them to die. He does not seem to have
7485 considered that the 'bridle of Theages' might be accompanied by
7486 qualities which were of far more value to the State than the health
7487 or strength of the citizens; or that the duty of taking care of the
7488 helpless might be an important element of education in a State. The
7489 physician himself (this is a delicate and subtle observation) should
7490 not be a man in robust health; he should have, in modern phraseology,
7491 a nervous temperament; he should have experience of disease in his own
7492 person, in order that his powers of observation may be quickened in the
7493 case of others.
7494 
7495 The perplexity of medicine is paralleled by the perplexity of law; in
7496 which, again, Plato would have men follow the golden rule of simplicity.
7497 Greater matters are to be determined by the legislator or by the oracle
7498 of Delphi, lesser matters are to be left to the temporary regulation
7499 of the citizens themselves. Plato is aware that laissez faire is an
7500 important element of government. The diseases of a State are like the
7501 heads of a hydra; they multiply when they are cut off. The true remedy
7502 for them is not extirpation but prevention. And the way to prevent them
7503 is to take care of education, and education will take care of all the
7504 rest. So in modern times men have often felt that the only political
7505 measure worth having--the only one which would produce any certain or
7506 lasting effect, was a measure of national education. And in our own more
7507 than in any previous age the necessity has been recognized of restoring
7508 the ever-increasing confusion of law to simplicity and common sense.
7509 
7510 When the training in music and gymnastic is completed, there follows the
7511 first stage of active and public life. But soon education is to begin
7512 again from a new point of view. In the interval between the Fourth and
7513 Seventh Books we have discussed the nature of knowledge, and have thence
7514 been led to form a higher conception of what was required of us. For
7515 true knowledge, according to Plato, is of abstractions, and has to do,
7516 not with particulars or individuals, but with universals only; not with
7517 the beauties of poetry, but with the ideas of philosophy. And the great
7518 aim of education is the cultivation of the habit of abstraction. This
7519 is to be acquired through the study of the mathematical sciences. They
7520 alone are capable of giving ideas of relation, and of arousing the
7521 dormant energies of thought.
7522 
7523 Mathematics in the age of Plato comprehended a very small part of that
7524 which is now included in them; but they bore a much larger proportion to
7525 the sum of human knowledge. They were the only organon of thought which
7526 the human mind at that time possessed, and the only measure by which
7527 the chaos of particulars could be reduced to rule and order. The
7528 faculty which they trained was naturally at war with the poetical
7529 or imaginative; and hence to Plato, who is everywhere seeking for
7530 abstractions and trying to get rid of the illusions of sense, nearly
7531 the whole of education is contained in them. They seemed to have an
7532 inexhaustible application, partly because their true limits were not yet
7533 understood. These Plato himself is beginning to investigate; though
7534 not aware that number and figure are mere abstractions of sense,
7535 he recognizes that the forms used by geometry are borrowed from the
7536 sensible world. He seeks to find the ultimate ground of mathematical
7537 ideas in the idea of good, though he does not satisfactorily explain the
7538 connexion between them; and in his conception of the relation of ideas
7539 to numbers, he falls very far short of the definiteness attributed to
7540 him by Aristotle (Met.). But if he fails to recognize the true limits of
7541 mathematics, he also reaches a point beyond them; in his view, ideas
7542 of number become secondary to a higher conception of knowledge. The
7543 dialectician is as much above the mathematician as the mathematician is
7544 above the ordinary man. The one, the self-proving, the good which is
7545 the higher sphere of dialectic, is the perfect truth to which all things
7546 ascend, and in which they finally repose.
7547 
7548 This self-proving unity or idea of good is a mere vision of which no
7549 distinct explanation can be given, relative only to a particular stage
7550 in Greek philosophy. It is an abstraction under which no individuals
7551 are comprehended, a whole which has no parts (Arist., Nic. Eth.). The
7552 vacancy of such a form was perceived by Aristotle, but not by Plato.
7553 Nor did he recognize that in the dialectical process are included two or
7554 more methods of investigation which are at variance with each other.
7555 He did not see that whether he took the longer or the shorter road, no
7556 advance could be made in this way. And yet such visions often have an
7557 immense effect; for although the method of science cannot anticipate
7558 science, the idea of science, not as it is, but as it will be in the
7559 future, is a great and inspiring principle. In the pursuit of knowledge
7560 we are always pressing forward to something beyond us; and as a false
7561 conception of knowledge, for example the scholastic philosophy, may lead
7562 men astray during many ages, so the true ideal, though vacant, may draw
7563 all their thoughts in a right direction. It makes a great difference
7564 whether the general expectation of knowledge, as this indefinite feeling
7565 may be termed, is based upon a sound judgment. For mankind may often
7566 entertain a true conception of what knowledge ought to be when they have
7567 but a slender experience of facts. The correlation of the sciences, the
7568 consciousness of the unity of nature, the idea of classification, the
7569 sense of proportion, the unwillingness to stop short of certainty or to
7570 confound probability with truth, are important principles of the higher
7571 education. Although Plato could tell us nothing, and perhaps knew that
7572 he could tell us nothing, of the absolute truth, he has exercised
7573 an influence on the human mind which even at the present day is not
7574 exhausted; and political and social questions may yet arise in which the
7575 thoughts of Plato may be read anew and receive a fresh meaning.
7576 
7577 The Idea of good is so called only in the Republic, but there are traces
7578 of it in other dialogues of Plato. It is a cause as well as an idea, and
7579 from this point of view may be compared with the creator of the Timaeus,
7580 who out of his goodness created all things. It corresponds to a certain
7581 extent with the modern conception of a law of nature, or of a final
7582 cause, or of both in one, and in this regard may be connected with the
7583 measure and symmetry of the Philebus. It is represented in the Symposium
7584 under the aspect of beauty, and is supposed to be attained there by
7585 stages of initiation, as here by regular gradations of knowledge. Viewed
7586 subjectively, it is the process or science of dialectic. This is the
7587 science which, according to the Phaedrus, is the true basis of rhetoric,
7588 which alone is able to distinguish the natures and classes of men and
7589 things; which divides a whole into the natural parts, and reunites the
7590 scattered parts into a natural or organized whole; which defines the
7591 abstract essences or universal ideas of all things, and connects them;
7592 which pierces the veil of hypotheses and reaches the final cause or
7593 first principle of all; which regards the sciences in relation to the
7594 idea of good. This ideal science is the highest process of thought,
7595 and may be described as the soul conversing with herself or holding
7596 communion with eternal truth and beauty, and in another form is
7597 the everlasting question and answer--the ceaseless interrogative of
7598 Socrates. The dialogues of Plato are themselves examples of the nature
7599 and method of dialectic. Viewed objectively, the idea of good is a power
7600 or cause which makes the world without us correspond with the world
7601 within. Yet this world without us is still a world of ideas. With Plato
7602 the investigation of nature is another department of knowledge, and in
7603 this he seeks to attain only probable conclusions (Timaeus).
7604 
7605 If we ask whether this science of dialectic which Plato only half
7606 explains to us is more akin to logic or to metaphysics, the answer is
7607 that in his mind the two sciences are not as yet distinguished, any more
7608 than the subjective and objective aspects of the world and of man, which
7609 German philosophy has revealed to us. Nor has he determined whether
7610 his science of dialectic is at rest or in motion, concerned with the
7611 contemplation of absolute being, or with a process of development
7612 and evolution. Modern metaphysics may be described as the science of
7613 abstractions, or as the science of the evolution of thought; modern
7614 logic, when passing beyond the bounds of mere Aristotelian forms, may be
7615 defined as the science of method. The germ of both of them is contained
7616 in the Platonic dialectic; all metaphysicians have something in common
7617 with the ideas of Plato; all logicians have derived something from
7618 the method of Plato. The nearest approach in modern philosophy to the
7619 universal science of Plato, is to be found in the Hegelian 'succession
7620 of moments in the unity of the idea.' Plato and Hegel alike seem to
7621 have conceived the world as the correlation of abstractions; and not
7622 impossibly they would have understood one another better than any of
7623 their commentators understand them (Swift's Voyage to Laputa. 'Having
7624 a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and
7625 learning, I set apart one day on purpose. I proposed that Homer and
7626 Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these
7627 were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court
7628 and outward rooms of the palace. I knew, and could distinguish these two
7629 heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.
7630 Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect
7631 for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever
7632 beheld. Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff. His visage was
7633 meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow. I soon discovered
7634 that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company,
7635 and had never seen or heard of them before. And I had a whisper from a
7636 ghost, who shall be nameless, "That these commentators always kept in
7637 the most distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world,
7638 through a consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly
7639 misrepresented the meaning of these authors to posterity." I introduced
7640 Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them
7641 better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a
7642 genius to enter into the spirit of a poet. But Aristotle was out of all
7643 patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented
7644 them to him; and he asked them "whether the rest of the tribe were as
7645 great dunces as themselves?"'). There is, however, a difference between
7646 them: for whereas Hegel is thinking of all the minds of men as one mind,
7647 which developes the stages of the idea in different countries or at
7648 different times in the same country, with Plato these gradations are
7649 regarded only as an order of thought or ideas; the history of the human
7650 mind had not yet dawned upon him.
7651 
7652 Many criticisms may be made on Plato's theory of education. While in
7653 some respects he unavoidably falls short of modern thinkers, in others
7654 he is in advance of them. He is opposed to the modes of education which
7655 prevailed in his own time; but he can hardly be said to have discovered
7656 new ones. He does not see that education is relative to the characters
7657 of individuals; he only desires to impress the same form of the state on
7658 the minds of all. He has no sufficient idea of the effect of literature
7659 on the formation of the mind, and greatly exaggerates that of
7660 mathematics. His aim is above all things to train the reasoning
7661 faculties; to implant in the mind the spirit and power of abstraction;
7662 to explain and define general notions, and, if possible, to connect
7663 them. No wonder that in the vacancy of actual knowledge his followers,
7664 and at times even he himself, should have fallen away from the doctrine
7665 of ideas, and have returned to that branch of knowledge in which alone
7666 the relation of the one and many can be truly seen--the science of
7667 number. In his views both of teaching and training he might be styled,
7668 in modern language, a doctrinaire; after the Spartan fashion he would
7669 have his citizens cast in one mould; he does not seem to consider that
7670 some degree of freedom, 'a little wholesome neglect,' is necessary to
7671 strengthen and develope the character and to give play to the individual
7672 nature. His citizens would not have acquired that knowledge which in
7673 the vision of Er is supposed to be gained by the pilgrims from their
7674 experience of evil.
7675 
7676 On the other hand, Plato is far in advance of modern philosophers and
7677 theologians when he teaches that education is to be continued through
7678 life and will begin again in another. He would never allow education of
7679 some kind to cease; although he was aware that the proverbial saying of
7680 Solon, 'I grow old learning many things,' cannot be applied literally.
7681 Himself ravished with the contemplation of the idea of good, and
7682 delighting in solid geometry (Rep.), he has no difficulty in imagining
7683 that a lifetime might be passed happily in such pursuits. We who know
7684 how many more men of business there are in the world than real students
7685 or thinkers, are not equally sanguine. The education which he proposes
7686 for his citizens is really the ideal life of the philosopher or man of
7687 genius, interrupted, but only for a time, by practical duties,--a life
7688 not for the many, but for the few.
7689 
7690 Yet the thought of Plato may not be wholly incapable of application to
7691 our own times. Even if regarded as an ideal which can never be realized,
7692 it may have a great effect in elevating the characters of mankind,
7693 and raising them above the routine of their ordinary occupation or
7694 profession. It is the best form under which we can conceive the whole
7695 of life. Nevertheless the idea of Plato is not easily put into practice.
7696 For the education of after life is necessarily the education which each
7697 one gives himself. Men and women cannot be brought together in schools
7698 or colleges at forty or fifty years of age; and if they could the result
7699 would be disappointing. The destination of most men is what Plato would
7700 call 'the Den' for the whole of life, and with that they are content.
7701 Neither have they teachers or advisers with whom they can take counsel
7702 in riper years. There is no 'schoolmaster abroad' who will tell them of
7703 their faults, or inspire them with the higher sense of duty, or with the
7704 ambition of a true success in life; no Socrates who will convict them
7705 of ignorance; no Christ, or follower of Christ, who will reprove them
7706 of sin. Hence they have a difficulty in receiving the first element of
7707 improvement, which is self-knowledge. The hopes of youth no longer stir
7708 them; they rather wish to rest than to pursue high objects. A few
7709 only who have come across great men and women, or eminent teachers of
7710 religion and morality, have received a second life from them, and have
7711 lighted a candle from the fire of their genius.
7712 
7713 The want of energy is one of the main reasons why so few persons
7714 continue to improve in later years. They have not the will, and do not
7715 know the way. They 'never try an experiment,' or look up a point
7716 of interest for themselves; they make no sacrifices for the sake of
7717 knowledge; their minds, like their bodies, at a certain age become
7718 fixed. Genius has been defined as 'the power of taking pains'; but
7719 hardly any one keeps up his interest in knowledge throughout a whole
7720 life. The troubles of a family, the business of making money, the
7721 demands of a profession destroy the elasticity of the mind. The waxen
7722 tablet of the memory which was once capable of receiving 'true thoughts
7723 and clear impressions' becomes hard and crowded; there is not room
7724 for the accumulations of a long life (Theaet.). The student, as years
7725 advance, rather makes an exchange of knowledge than adds to his stores.
7726 There is no pressing necessity to learn; the stock of Classics or
7727 History or Natural Science which was enough for a man at twenty-five is
7728 enough for him at fifty. Neither is it easy to give a definite answer to
7729 any one who asks how he is to improve. For self-education consists in a
7730 thousand things, commonplace in themselves,--in adding to what we are
7731 by nature something of what we are not; in learning to see ourselves as
7732 others see us; in judging, not by opinion, but by the evidence of facts;
7733 in seeking out the society of superior minds; in a study of lives and
7734 writings of great men; in observation of the world and character; in
7735 receiving kindly the natural influence of different times of life; in
7736 any act or thought which is raised above the practice or opinions of
7737 mankind; in the pursuit of some new or original enquiry; in any effort
7738 of mind which calls forth some latent power.
7739 
7740 If any one is desirous of carrying out in detail the Platonic education
7741 of after-life, some such counsels as the following may be offered to
7742 him:--That he shall choose the branch of knowledge to which his own mind
7743 most distinctly inclines, and in which he takes the greatest delight,
7744 either one which seems to connect with his own daily employment, or,
7745 perhaps, furnishes the greatest contrast to it. He may study from the
7746 speculative side the profession or business in which he is practically
7747 engaged. He may make Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Plato, Bacon the friends
7748 and companions of his life. He may find opportunities of hearing the
7749 living voice of a great teacher. He may select for enquiry some point of
7750 history or some unexplained phenomenon of nature. An hour a day passed
7751 in such scientific or literary pursuits will furnish as many facts as
7752 the memory can retain, and will give him 'a pleasure not to be repented
7753 of' (Timaeus). Only let him beware of being the slave of crotchets, or
7754 of running after a Will o' the Wisp in his ignorance, or in his vanity
7755 of attributing to himself the gifts of a poet or assuming the air of
7756 a philosopher. He should know the limits of his own powers. Better to
7757 build up the mind by slow additions, to creep on quietly from one
7758 thing to another, to gain insensibly new powers and new interests in
7759 knowledge, than to form vast schemes which are never destined to be
7760 realized. But perhaps, as Plato would say, 'This is part of another
7761 subject' (Tim.); though we may also defend our digression by his example
7762 (Theaet.).
7763 
7764 4. We remark with surprise that the progress of nations or the natural
7765 growth of institutions which fill modern treatises on political
7766 philosophy seem hardly ever to have attracted the attention of Plato
7767 and Aristotle. The ancients were familiar with the mutability of human
7768 affairs; they could moralize over the ruins of cities and the fall of
7769 empires (Plato, Statesman, and Sulpicius' Letter to Cicero); by them
7770 fate and chance were deemed to be real powers, almost persons, and
7771 to have had a great share in political events. The wiser of them like
7772 Thucydides believed that 'what had been would be again,' and that a
7773 tolerable idea of the future could be gathered from the past. Also they
7774 had dreams of a Golden Age which existed once upon a time and might
7775 still exist in some unknown land, or might return again in the remote
7776 future. But the regular growth of a state enlightened by experience,
7777 progressing in knowledge, improving in the arts, of which the citizens
7778 were educated by the fulfilment of political duties, appears never to
7779 have come within the range of their hopes and aspirations. Such a state
7780 had never been seen, and therefore could not be conceived by them. Their
7781 experience (Aristot. Metaph.; Plato, Laws) led them to conclude that
7782 there had been cycles of civilization in which the arts had been
7783 discovered and lost many times over, and cities had been overthrown and
7784 rebuilt again and again, and deluges and volcanoes and other natural
7785 convulsions had altered the face of the earth. Tradition told them of
7786 many destructions of mankind and of the preservation of a remnant.
7787 The world began again after a deluge and was reconstructed out of the
7788 fragments of itself. Also they were acquainted with empires of unknown
7789 antiquity, like the Egyptian or Assyrian; but they had never seen them
7790 grow, and could not imagine, any more than we can, the state of man
7791 which preceded them. They were puzzled and awestricken by the Egyptian
7792 monuments, of which the forms, as Plato says, not in a figure, but
7793 literally, were ten thousand years old (Laws), and they contrasted the
7794 antiquity of Egypt with their own short memories.
7795 
7796 The early legends of Hellas have no real connection with the later
7797 history: they are at a distance, and the intermediate region is
7798 concealed from view; there is no road or path which leads from one to
7799 the other. At the beginning of Greek history, in the vestibule of the
7800 temple, is seen standing first of all the figure of the legislator,
7801 himself the interpreter and servant of the God. The fundamental laws
7802 which he gives are not supposed to change with time and circumstances.
7803 The salvation of the state is held rather to depend on the inviolable
7804 maintenance of them. They were sanctioned by the authority of heaven,
7805 and it was deemed impiety to alter them. The desire to maintain
7806 them unaltered seems to be the origin of what at first sight is very
7807 surprising to us--the intolerant zeal of Plato against innovators in
7808 religion or politics (Laws); although with a happy inconsistency he
7809 is also willing that the laws of other countries should be studied and
7810 improvements in legislation privately communicated to the Nocturnal
7811 Council (Laws). The additions which were made to them in later ages in
7812 order to meet the increasing complexity of affairs were still ascribed
7813 by a fiction to the original legislator; and the words of such
7814 enactments at Athens were disputed over as if they had been the words of
7815 Solon himself. Plato hopes to preserve in a later generation the mind of
7816 the legislator; he would have his citizens remain within the lines
7817 which he has laid down for them. He would not harass them with minute
7818 regulations, he would have allowed some changes in the laws: but not
7819 changes which would affect the fundamental institutions of the state,
7820 such for example as would convert an aristocracy into a timocracy, or a
7821 timocracy into a popular form of government.
7822 
7823 Passing from speculations to facts, we observe that progress has been
7824 the exception rather than the law of human history. And therefore we are
7825 not surprised to find that the idea of progress is of modern rather than
7826 of ancient date; and, like the idea of a philosophy of history, is
7827 not more than a century or two old. It seems to have arisen out of the
7828 impression left on the human mind by the growth of the Roman Empire
7829 and of the Christian Church, and to be due to the political and social
7830 improvements which they introduced into the world; and still more in
7831 our own century to the idealism of the first French Revolution and the
7832 triumph of American Independence; and in a yet greater degree to the
7833 vast material prosperity and growth of population in England and her
7834 colonies and in America. It is also to be ascribed in a measure to the
7835 greater study of the philosophy of history. The optimist temperament of
7836 some great writers has assisted the creation of it, while the opposite
7837 character has led a few to regard the future of the world as dark.
7838 The 'spectator of all time and of all existence' sees more of 'the
7839 increasing purpose which through the ages ran' than formerly: but to the
7840 inhabitant of a small state of Hellas the vision was necessarily limited
7841 like the valley in which he dwelt. There was no remote past on which his
7842 eye could rest, nor any future from which the veil was partly lifted up
7843 by the analogy of history. The narrowness of view, which to ourselves
7844 appears so singular, was to him natural, if not unavoidable.
7845 
7846 5. For the relation of the Republic to the Statesman and the Laws, and
7847 the two other works of Plato which directly treat of politics, see the
7848 Introductions to the two latter; a few general points of comparison may
7849 be touched upon in this place.
7850 
7851 And first of the Laws.
7852 
7853 (1) The Republic, though probably written at intervals, yet speaking
7854 generally and judging by the indications of thought and style, may be
7855 reasonably ascribed to the middle period of Plato's life: the Laws are
7856 certainly the work of his declining years, and some portions of them at
7857 any rate seem to have been written in extreme old age.
7858 
7859 (2) The Republic is full of hope and aspiration: the Laws bear the stamp
7860 of failure and disappointment. The one is a finished work which received
7861 the last touches of the author: the other is imperfectly executed, and
7862 apparently unfinished. The one has the grace and beauty of youth: the
7863 other has lost the poetical form, but has more of the severity and
7864 knowledge of life which is characteristic of old age.
7865 
7866 (3) The most conspicuous defect of the Laws is the failure of dramatic
7867 power, whereas the Republic is full of striking contrasts of ideas and
7868 oppositions of character.
7869 
7870 (4) The Laws may be said to have more the nature of a sermon,
7871 the Republic of a poem; the one is more religious, the other more
7872 intellectual.
7873 
7874 (5) Many theories of Plato, such as the doctrine of ideas, the
7875 government of the world by philosophers, are not found in the Laws;
7876 the immortality of the soul is first mentioned in xii; the person of
7877 Socrates has altogether disappeared. The community of women and children
7878 is renounced; the institution of common or public meals for women (Laws)
7879 is for the first time introduced (Ar. Pol.).
7880 
7881 (6) There remains in the Laws the old enmity to the poets, who are
7882 ironically saluted in high-flown terms, and, at the same time, are
7883 peremptorily ordered out of the city, if they are not willing to submit
7884 their poems to the censorship of the magistrates (Rep.).
7885 
7886 (7) Though the work is in most respects inferior, there are a few
7887 passages in the Laws, such as the honour due to the soul, the evils
7888 of licentious or unnatural love, the whole of Book x. (religion), the
7889 dishonesty of retail trade, and bequests, which come more home to us,
7890 and contain more of what may be termed the modern element in Plato than
7891 almost anything in the Republic.
7892 
7893 The relation of the two works to one another is very well given:
7894 
7895 (1) by Aristotle in the Politics from the side of the Laws:--
7896 
7897 'The same, or nearly the same, objections apply to Plato's later work,
7898 the Laws, and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution
7899 which is therein described. In the Republic, Socrates has definitely
7900 settled in all a few questions only; such as the community of women and
7901 children, the community of property, and the constitution of the state.
7902 The population is divided into two classes--one of husbandmen, and
7903 the other of warriors; from this latter is taken a third class of
7904 counsellors and rulers of the state. But Socrates has not determined
7905 whether the husbandmen and artists are to have a share in the
7906 government, and whether they too are to carry arms and share in military
7907 service or not. He certainly thinks that the women ought to share in the
7908 education of the guardians, and to fight by their side. The remainder of
7909 the work is filled up with digressions foreign to the main subject, and
7910 with discussions about the education of the guardians. In the Laws there
7911 is hardly anything but laws; not much is said about the constitution.
7912 This, which he had intended to make more of the ordinary type, he
7913 gradually brings round to the other or ideal form. For with the
7914 exception of the community of women and property, he supposes everything
7915 to be the same in both states; there is to be the same education; the
7916 citizens of both are to live free from servile occupations, and there
7917 are to be common meals in both. The only difference is that in the Laws
7918 the common meals are extended to women, and the warriors number about
7919 5000, but in the Republic only 1000.'
7920 
7921 (2) by Plato in the Laws (Book v.), from the side of the Republic:--
7922 
7923 'The first and highest form of the state and of the government and of
7924 the law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying
7925 that "Friends have all things in common." Whether there is now, or ever
7926 will be, this communion of women and children and of property, in which
7927 the private and individual is altogether banished from life, and things
7928 which are by nature private, such as eyes and ears and hands, have
7929 become common, and all men express praise and blame, and feel joy
7930 and sorrow, on the same occasions, and the laws unite the city to the
7931 utmost,--whether all this is possible or not, I say that no man, acting
7932 upon any other principle, will ever constitute a state more exalted in
7933 virtue, or truer or better than this. Such a state, whether inhabited
7934 by Gods or sons of Gods, will make them blessed who dwell therein; and
7935 therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of the state, and to
7936 cling to this, and, as far as possible, to seek for one which is like
7937 this. The state which we have now in hand, when created, will be nearest
7938 to immortality and unity in the next degree; and after that, by the
7939 grace of God, we will complete the third one. And we will begin by
7940 speaking of the nature and origin of the second.'
7941 
7942 The comparatively short work called the Statesman or Politicus in its
7943 style and manner is more akin to the Laws, while in its idealism
7944 it rather resembles the Republic. As far as we can judge by various
7945 indications of language and thought, it must be later than the one and
7946 of course earlier than the other. In both the Republic and Statesman a
7947 close connection is maintained between Politics and Dialectic. In the
7948 Statesman, enquiries into the principles of Method are interspersed with
7949 discussions about Politics. The comparative advantages of the rule of
7950 law and of a person are considered, and the decision given in favour of
7951 a person (Arist. Pol.). But much may be said on the other side, nor is
7952 the opposition necessary; for a person may rule by law, and law may
7953 be so applied as to be the living voice of the legislator. As in the
7954 Republic, there is a myth, describing, however, not a future, but a
7955 former existence of mankind. The question is asked, 'Whether the state
7956 of innocence which is described in the myth, or a state like our own
7957 which possesses art and science and distinguishes good from evil, is
7958 the preferable condition of man.' To this question of the comparative
7959 happiness of civilized and primitive life, which was so often discussed
7960 in the last century and in our own, no answer is given. The Statesman,
7961 though less perfect in style than the Republic and of far less range,
7962 may justly be regarded as one of the greatest of Plato's dialogues.
7963 
7964 6. Others as well as Plato have chosen an ideal Republic to be the
7965 vehicle of thoughts which they could not definitely express, or which
7966 went beyond their own age. The classical writing which approaches most
7967 nearly to the Republic of Plato is the 'De Republica' of Cicero; but
7968 neither in this nor in any other of his dialogues does he rival the
7969 art of Plato. The manners are clumsy and inferior; the hand of the
7970 rhetorician is apparent at every turn. Yet noble sentiments are
7971 constantly recurring: the true note of Roman patriotism--'We Romans are
7972 a great people'--resounds through the whole work. Like Socrates, Cicero
7973 turns away from the phenomena of the heavens to civil and political
7974 life. He would rather not discuss the 'two Suns' of which all Rome was
7975 talking, when he can converse about 'the two nations in one' which had
7976 divided Rome ever since the days of the Gracchi. Like Socrates again,
7977 speaking in the person of Scipio, he is afraid lest he should assume
7978 too much the character of a teacher, rather than of an equal who is
7979 discussing among friends the two sides of a question. He would confine
7980 the terms King or State to the rule of reason and justice, and he will
7981 not concede that title either to a democracy or to a monarchy. But under
7982 the rule of reason and justice he is willing to include the natural
7983 superior ruling over the natural inferior, which he compares to the soul
7984 ruling over the body. He prefers a mixture of forms of government to any
7985 single one. The two portraits of the just and the unjust, which occur in
7986 the second book of the Republic, are transferred to the state--Philus,
7987 one of the interlocutors, maintaining against his will the necessity
7988 of injustice as a principle of government, while the other, Laelius,
7989 supports the opposite thesis. His views of language and number are
7990 derived from Plato; like him he denounces the drama. He also declares
7991 that if his life were to be twice as long he would have no time to read
7992 the lyric poets. The picture of democracy is translated by him word for
7993 word, though he had hardly shown himself able to 'carry the jest' of
7994 Plato. He converts into a stately sentence the humorous fancy about the
7995 animals, who 'are so imbued with the spirit of democracy that they make
7996 the passers-by get out of their way.' His description of the tyrant is
7997 imitated from Plato, but is far inferior. The second book is historical,
7998 and claims for the Roman constitution (which is to him the ideal) a
7999 foundation of fact such as Plato probably intended to have given to the
8000 Republic in the Critias. His most remarkable imitation of Plato is the
8001 adaptation of the vision of Er, which is converted by Cicero into the
8002 'Somnium Scipionis'; he has 'romanized' the myth of the Republic, adding
8003 an argument for the immortality of the soul taken from the Phaedrus,
8004 and some other touches derived from the Phaedo and the Timaeus. Though a
8005 beautiful tale and containing splendid passages, the 'Somnium Scipionis;
8006 is very inferior to the vision of Er; it is only a dream, and hardly
8007 allows the reader to suppose that the writer believes in his own
8008 creation. Whether his dialogues were framed on the model of the lost
8009 dialogues of Aristotle, as he himself tells us, or of Plato, to which
8010 they bear many superficial resemblances, he is still the Roman orator;
8011 he is not conversing, but making speeches, and is never able to mould
8012 the intractable Latin to the grace and ease of the Greek Platonic
8013 dialogue. But if he is defective in form, much more is he inferior to
8014 the Greek in matter; he nowhere in his philosophical writings leaves
8015 upon our minds the impression of an original thinker.
8016 
8017 Plato's Republic has been said to be a church and not a state; and such
8018 an ideal of a city in the heavens has always hovered over the Christian
8019 world, and is embodied in St. Augustine's 'De Civitate Dei,' which is
8020 suggested by the decay and fall of the Roman Empire, much in the same
8021 manner in which we may imagine the Republic of Plato to have been
8022 influenced by the decline of Greek politics in the writer's own age. The
8023 difference is that in the time of Plato the degeneracy, though certain,
8024 was gradual and insensible: whereas the taking of Rome by the Goths
8025 stirred like an earthquake the age of St. Augustine. Men were inclined
8026 to believe that the overthrow of the city was to be ascribed to the
8027 anger felt by the old Roman deities at the neglect of their worship. St.
8028 Augustine maintains the opposite thesis; he argues that the destruction
8029 of the Roman Empire is due, not to the rise of Christianity, but to
8030 the vices of Paganism. He wanders over Roman history, and over Greek
8031 philosophy and mythology, and finds everywhere crime, impiety and
8032 falsehood. He compares the worst parts of the Gentile religions with
8033 the best elements of the faith of Christ. He shows nothing of the spirit
8034 which led others of the early Christian Fathers to recognize in the
8035 writings of the Greek philosophers the power of the divine truth. He
8036 traces the parallel of the kingdom of God, that is, the history of the
8037 Jews, contained in their scriptures, and of the kingdoms of the world,
8038 which are found in gentile writers, and pursues them both into an ideal
8039 future. It need hardly be remarked that his use both of Greek and
8040 of Roman historians and of the sacred writings of the Jews is wholly
8041 uncritical. The heathen mythology, the Sybilline oracles, the myths
8042 of Plato, the dreams of Neo-Platonists are equally regarded by him as
8043 matter of fact. He must be acknowledged to be a strictly polemical or
8044 controversial writer who makes the best of everything on one side and
8045 the worst of everything on the other. He has no sympathy with the old
8046 Roman life as Plato has with Greek life, nor has he any idea of the
8047 ecclesiastical kingdom which was to arise out of the ruins of the Roman
8048 empire. He is not blind to the defects of the Christian Church, and
8049 looks forward to a time when Christian and Pagan shall be alike brought
8050 before the judgment-seat, and the true City of God shall appear...The
8051 work of St. Augustine is a curious repertory of antiquarian learning and
8052 quotations, deeply penetrated with Christian ethics, but showing little
8053 power of reasoning, and a slender knowledge of the Greek literature
8054 and language. He was a great genius, and a noble character, yet hardly
8055 capable of feeling or understanding anything external to his own
8056 theology. Of all the ancient philosophers he is most attracted by Plato,
8057 though he is very slightly acquainted with his writings. He is inclined
8058 to believe that the idea of creation in the Timaeus is derived from the
8059 narrative in Genesis; and he is strangely taken with the coincidence (?)
8060 of Plato's saying that 'the philosopher is the lover of God,' and
8061 the words of the Book of Exodus in which God reveals himself to Moses
8062 (Exod.) He dwells at length on miracles performed in his own day, of
8063 which the evidence is regarded by him as irresistible. He speaks in a
8064 very interesting manner of the beauty and utility of nature and of the
8065 human frame, which he conceives to afford a foretaste of the heavenly
8066 state and of the resurrection of the body. The book is not really what
8067 to most persons the title of it would imply, and belongs to an age which
8068 has passed away. But it contains many fine passages and thoughts which
8069 are for all time.
8070 
8071 The short treatise de Monarchia of Dante is by far the most remarkable
8072 of mediaeval ideals, and bears the impress of the great genius in whom
8073 Italy and the Middle Ages are so vividly reflected. It is the vision of
8074 an Universal Empire, which is supposed to be the natural and necessary
8075 government of the world, having a divine authority distinct from the
8076 Papacy, yet coextensive with it. It is not 'the ghost of the dead Roman
8077 Empire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof,' but the legitimate heir
8078 and successor of it, justified by the ancient virtues of the Romans and
8079 the beneficence of their rule. Their right to be the governors of the
8080 world is also confirmed by the testimony of miracles, and acknowledged
8081 by St. Paul when he appealed to Caesar, and even more emphatically by
8082 Christ Himself, Who could not have made atonement for the sins of men
8083 if He had not been condemned by a divinely authorized tribunal. The
8084 necessity for the establishment of an Universal Empire is proved partly
8085 by a priori arguments such as the unity of God and the unity of the
8086 family or nation; partly by perversions of Scripture and history, by
8087 false analogies of nature, by misapplied quotations from the classics,
8088 and by odd scraps and commonplaces of logic, showing a familiar but by
8089 no means exact knowledge of Aristotle (of Plato there is none). But
8090 a more convincing argument still is the miserable state of the world,
8091 which he touchingly describes. He sees no hope of happiness or peace
8092 for mankind until all nations of the earth are comprehended in a single
8093 empire. The whole treatise shows how deeply the idea of the Roman Empire
8094 was fixed in the minds of his contemporaries. Not much argument was
8095 needed to maintain the truth of a theory which to his own contemporaries
8096 seemed so natural and congenial. He speaks, or rather preaches, from the
8097 point of view, not of the ecclesiastic, but of the layman, although, as
8098 a good Catholic, he is willing to acknowledge that in certain respects
8099 the Empire must submit to the Church. The beginning and end of all his
8100 noble reflections and of his arguments, good and bad, is the aspiration
8101 'that in this little plot of earth belonging to mortal man life may pass
8102 in freedom and peace.' So inextricably is his vision of the future bound
8103 up with the beliefs and circumstances of his own age.
8104 
8105 The 'Utopia' of Sir Thomas More is a surprising monument of his genius,
8106 and shows a reach of thought far beyond his contemporaries. The book was
8107 written by him at the age of about 34 or 35, and is full of the generous
8108 sentiments of youth. He brings the light of Plato to bear upon the
8109 miserable state of his own country. Living not long after the Wars of
8110 the Roses, and in the dregs of the Catholic Church in England, he is
8111 indignant at the corruption of the clergy, at the luxury of the nobility
8112 and gentry, at the sufferings of the poor, at the calamities caused by
8113 war. To the eye of More the whole world was in dissolution and decay;
8114 and side by side with the misery and oppression which he has described
8115 in the First Book of the Utopia, he places in the Second Book the ideal
8116 state which by the help of Plato he had constructed. The times were full
8117 of stir and intellectual interest. The distant murmur of the Reformation
8118 was beginning to be heard. To minds like More's, Greek literature was
8119 a revelation: there had arisen an art of interpretation, and the New
8120 Testament was beginning to be understood as it had never been before,
8121 and has not often been since, in its natural sense. The life there
8122 depicted appeared to him wholly unlike that of Christian commonwealths,
8123 in which 'he saw nothing but a certain conspiracy of rich men procuring
8124 their own commodities under the name and title of the Commonwealth.'
8125 He thought that Christ, like Plato, 'instituted all things common,' for
8126 which reason, he tells us, the citizens of Utopia were the more willing
8127 to receive his doctrines ('Howbeit, I think this was no small help and
8128 furtherance in the matter, that they heard us say that Christ instituted
8129 among his, all things common, and that the same community doth yet
8130 remain in the rightest Christian communities' (Utopia).). The community
8131 of property is a fixed idea with him, though he is aware of the
8132 arguments which may be urged on the other side ('These things (I say),
8133 when I consider with myself, I hold well with Plato, and do nothing
8134 marvel that he would make no laws for them that refused those laws,
8135 whereby all men should have and enjoy equal portions of riches and
8136 commodities. For the wise men did easily foresee this to be the one and
8137 only way to the wealth of a community, if equality of all things should
8138 be brought in and established' (Utopia).). We wonder how in the reign of
8139 Henry VIII, though veiled in another language and published in a foreign
8140 country, such speculations could have been endured.
8141 
8142 He is gifted with far greater dramatic invention than any one who
8143 succeeded him, with the exception of Swift. In the art of feigning he is
8144 a worthy disciple of Plato. Like him, starting from a small portion
8145 of fact, he founds his tale with admirable skill on a few lines in the
8146 Latin narrative of the voyages of Amerigo Vespucci. He is very precise
8147 about dates and facts, and has the power of making us believe that the
8148 narrator of the tale must have been an eyewitness. We are fairly puzzled
8149 by his manner of mixing up real and imaginary persons; his boy John
8150 Clement and Peter Giles, citizen of Antwerp, with whom he disputes
8151 about the precise words which are supposed to have been used by the
8152 (imaginary) Portuguese traveller, Raphael Hythloday. 'I have the more
8153 cause,' says Hythloday, 'to fear that my words shall not be believed,
8154 for that I know how difficultly and hardly I myself would have believed
8155 another man telling the same, if I had not myself seen it with mine own
8156 eyes.' Or again: 'If you had been with me in Utopia, and had presently
8157 seen their fashions and laws as I did which lived there five years and
8158 more, and would never have come thence, but only to make the new land
8159 known here,' etc. More greatly regrets that he forgot to ask Hythloday
8160 in what part of the world Utopia is situated; he 'would have spent no
8161 small sum of money rather than it should have escaped him,' and he begs
8162 Peter Giles to see Hythloday or write to him and obtain an answer to the
8163 question. After this we are not surprised to hear that a Professor of
8164 Divinity (perhaps 'a late famous vicar of Croydon in Surrey,' as the
8165 translator thinks) is desirous of being sent thither as a missionary by
8166 the High Bishop, 'yea, and that he may himself be made Bishop of Utopia,
8167 nothing doubting that he must obtain this Bishopric with suit; and he
8168 counteth that a godly suit which proceedeth not of the desire of honour
8169 or lucre, but only of a godly zeal.' The design may have failed through
8170 the disappearance of Hythloday, concerning whom we have 'very uncertain
8171 news' after his departure. There is no doubt, however, that he had told
8172 More and Giles the exact situation of the island, but unfortunately at
8173 the same moment More's attention, as he is reminded in a letter from
8174 Giles, was drawn off by a servant, and one of the company from a cold
8175 caught on shipboard coughed so loud as to prevent Giles from hearing.
8176 And 'the secret has perished' with him; to this day the place of Utopia
8177 remains unknown.
8178 
8179 The words of Phaedrus, 'O Socrates, you can easily invent Egyptians or
8180 anything,' are recalled to our mind as we read this lifelike fiction.
8181 Yet the greater merit of the work is not the admirable art, but the
8182 originality of thought. More is as free as Plato from the prejudices
8183 of his age, and far more tolerant. The Utopians do not allow him
8184 who believes not in the immortality of the soul to share in the
8185 administration of the state (Laws), 'howbeit they put him to no
8186 punishment, because they be persuaded that it is in no man's power to
8187 believe what he list'; and 'no man is to be blamed for reasoning in
8188 support of his own religion ('One of our company in my presence was
8189 sharply punished. He, as soon as he was baptised, began, against our
8190 wills, with more earnest affection than wisdom, to reason of Christ's
8191 religion, and began to wax so hot in his matter, that he did not only
8192 prefer our religion before all other, but also did despise and condemn
8193 all other, calling them profane, and the followers of them wicked and
8194 devilish, and the children of everlasting damnation. When he had thus
8195 long reasoned the matter, they laid hold on him, accused him, and
8196 condemned him into exile, not as a despiser of religion, but as a
8197 seditious person and a raiser up of dissension among the people').'
8198 In the public services 'no prayers be used, but such as every man
8199 may boldly pronounce without giving offence to any sect.' He says
8200 significantly, 'There be that give worship to a man that was once of
8201 excellent virtue or of famous glory, not only as God, but also the
8202 chiefest and highest God. But the most and the wisest part, rejecting
8203 all these, believe that there is a certain godly power unknown, far
8204 above the capacity and reach of man's wit, dispersed throughout all the
8205 world, not in bigness, but in virtue and power. Him they call the Father
8206 of all. To Him alone they attribute the beginnings, the increasings, the
8207 proceedings, the changes, and the ends of all things. Neither give they
8208 any divine honours to any other than him.' So far was More from sharing
8209 the popular beliefs of his time. Yet at the end he reminds us that he
8210 does not in all respects agree with the customs and opinions of the
8211 Utopians which he describes. And we should let him have the benefit of
8212 this saving clause, and not rudely withdraw the veil behind which he has
8213 been pleased to conceal himself.
8214 
8215 Nor is he less in advance of popular opinion in his political and moral
8216 speculations. He would like to bring military glory into contempt; he
8217 would set all sorts of idle people to profitable occupation, including
8218 in the same class, priests, women, noblemen, gentlemen, and 'sturdy and
8219 valiant beggars,' that the labour of all may be reduced to six hours a
8220 day. His dislike of capital punishment, and plans for the reformation of
8221 offenders; his detestation of priests and lawyers (Compare his satirical
8222 observation: 'They (the Utopians) have priests of exceeding holiness,
8223 and therefore very few.); his remark that 'although every one may hear
8224 of ravenous dogs and wolves and cruel man-eaters, it is not easy to find
8225 states that are well and wisely governed,' are curiously at variance
8226 with the notions of his age and indeed with his own life. There are many
8227 points in which he shows a modern feeling and a prophetic insight like
8228 Plato. He is a sanitary reformer; he maintains that civilized states
8229 have a right to the soil of waste countries; he is inclined to the
8230 opinion which places happiness in virtuous pleasures, but herein, as he
8231 thinks, not disagreeing from those other philosophers who define virtue
8232 to be a life according to nature. He extends the idea of happiness so as
8233 to include the happiness of others; and he argues ingeniously, 'All men
8234 agree that we ought to make others happy; but if others, how much more
8235 ourselves!' And still he thinks that there may be a more excellent way,
8236 but to this no man's reason can attain unless heaven should inspire him
8237 with a higher truth. His ceremonies before marriage; his humane proposal
8238 that war should be carried on by assassinating the leaders of the enemy,
8239 may be compared to some of the paradoxes of Plato. He has a charming
8240 fancy, like the affinities of Greeks and barbarians in the Timaeus, that
8241 the Utopians learnt the language of the Greeks with the more readiness
8242 because they were originally of the same race with them. He is
8243 penetrated with the spirit of Plato, and quotes or adapts many thoughts
8244 both from the Republic and from the Timaeus. He prefers public duties to
8245 private, and is somewhat impatient of the importunity of relations. His
8246 citizens have no silver or gold of their own, but are ready enough to
8247 pay them to their mercenaries. There is nothing of which he is more
8248 contemptuous than the love of money. Gold is used for fetters of
8249 criminals, and diamonds and pearls for children's necklaces (When the
8250 ambassadors came arrayed in gold and peacocks' feathers 'to the eyes of
8251 all the Utopians except very few, which had been in other countries for
8252 some reasonable cause, all that gorgeousness of apparel seemed shameful
8253 and reproachful. In so much that they most reverently saluted the
8254 vilest and most abject of them for lords--passing over the ambassadors
8255 themselves without any honour, judging them by their wearing of golden
8256 chains to be bondmen. You should have seen children also, that had cast
8257 away their pearls and precious stones, when they saw the like sticking
8258 upon the ambassadors' caps, dig and push their mothers under the sides,
8259 saying thus to them--"Look, though he were a little child still." But
8260 the mother; yea and that also in good earnest: "Peace, son," saith she,
8261 "I think he be some of the ambassadors' fools."')
8262 
8263 Like Plato he is full of satirical reflections on governments and
8264 princes; on the state of the world and of knowledge. The hero of his
8265 discourse (Hythloday) is very unwilling to become a minister of state,
8266 considering that he would lose his independence and his advice would
8267 never be heeded (Compare an exquisite passage, of which the conclusion
8268 is as follows: 'And verily it is naturally given...suppressed and
8269 ended.') He ridicules the new logic of his time; the Utopians could
8270 never be made to understand the doctrine of Second Intentions ('For they
8271 have not devised one of all those rules of restrictions, amplifications,
8272 and suppositions, very wittily invented in the small Logicals, which
8273 here our children in every place do learn. Furthermore, they were never
8274 yet able to find out the second intentions; insomuch that none of them
8275 all could ever see man himself in common, as they call him, though he be
8276 (as you know) bigger than was ever any giant, yea, and pointed to of us
8277 even with our finger.') He is very severe on the sports of the gentry;
8278 the Utopians count 'hunting the lowest, the vilest, and the most abject
8279 part of butchery.' He quotes the words of the Republic in which the
8280 philosopher is described 'standing out of the way under a wall until the
8281 driving storm of sleet and rain be overpast,' which admit of a singular
8282 application to More's own fate; although, writing twenty years before
8283 (about the year 1514), he can hardly be supposed to have foreseen this.
8284 There is no touch of satire which strikes deeper than his quiet remark
8285 that the greater part of the precepts of Christ are more at variance
8286 with the lives of ordinary Christians than the discourse of Utopia ('And
8287 yet the most part of them is more dissident from the manners of the
8288 world now a days, than my communication was. But preachers, sly and
8289 wily men, following your counsel (as I suppose) because they saw men
8290 evil-willing to frame their manners to Christ's rule, they have wrested
8291 and wried his doctrine, and, like a rule of lead, have applied it to
8292 men's manners, that by some means at the least way, they might agree
8293 together.')
8294 
8295 The 'New Atlantis' is only a fragment, and far inferior in merit to the
8296 'Utopia.' The work is full of ingenuity, but wanting in creative fancy,
8297 and by no means impresses the reader with a sense of credibility. In
8298 some places Lord Bacon is characteristically different from Sir Thomas
8299 More, as, for example, in the external state which he attributes to the
8300 governor of Solomon's House, whose dress he minutely describes, while to
8301 Sir Thomas More such trappings appear simple ridiculous. Yet, after this
8302 programme of dress, Bacon adds the beautiful trait, 'that he had a look
8303 as though he pitied men.' Several things are borrowed by him from the
8304 Timaeus; but he has injured the unity of style by adding thoughts and
8305 passages which are taken from the Hebrew Scriptures.
8306 
8307 The 'City of the Sun' written by Campanella (1568-1639), a Dominican
8308 friar, several years after the 'New Atlantis' of Bacon, has many
8309 resemblances to the Republic of Plato. The citizens have wives and
8310 children in common; their marriages are of the same temporary sort, and
8311 are arranged by the magistrates from time to time. They do not, however,
8312 adopt his system of lots, but bring together the best natures, male and
8313 female, 'according to philosophical rules.' The infants until two years
8314 of age are brought up by their mothers in public temples; and since
8315 individuals for the most part educate their children badly, at the
8316 beginning of their third year they are committed to the care of the
8317 State, and are taught at first, not out of books, but from paintings of
8318 all kinds, which are emblazoned on the walls of the city. The city has
8319 six interior circuits of walls, and an outer wall which is the
8320 seventh. On this outer wall are painted the figures of legislators and
8321 philosophers, and on each of the interior walls the symbols or forms
8322 of some one of the sciences are delineated. The women are, for the most
8323 part, trained, like the men, in warlike and other exercises; but they
8324 have two special occupations of their own. After a battle, they and the
8325 boys soothe and relieve the wounded warriors; also they encourage them
8326 with embraces and pleasant words. Some elements of the Christian or
8327 Catholic religion are preserved among them. The life of the Apostles is
8328 greatly admired by this people because they had all things in common;
8329 and the short prayer which Jesus Christ taught men is used in their
8330 worship. It is a duty of the chief magistrates to pardon sins, and
8331 therefore the whole people make secret confession of them to the
8332 magistrates, and they to their chief, who is a sort of Rector
8333 Metaphysicus; and by this means he is well informed of all that is going
8334 on in the minds of men. After confession, absolution is granted to
8335 the citizens collectively, but no one is mentioned by name. There
8336 also exists among them a practice of perpetual prayer, performed by
8337 a succession of priests, who change every hour. Their religion is
8338 a worship of God in Trinity, that is of Wisdom, Love and Power,
8339 but without any distinction of persons. They behold in the sun the
8340 reflection of His glory; mere graven images they reject, refusing to
8341 fall under the 'tyranny' of idolatry.
8342 
8343 Many details are given about their customs of eating and drinking, about
8344 their mode of dressing, their employments, their wars. Campanella looks
8345 forward to a new mode of education, which is to be a study of nature,
8346 and not of Aristotle. He would not have his citizens waste their time
8347 in the consideration of what he calls 'the dead signs of things.' He
8348 remarks that he who knows one science only, does not really know that
8349 one any more than the rest, and insists strongly on the necessity of a
8350 variety of knowledge. More scholars are turned out in the City of the
8351 Sun in one year than by contemporary methods in ten or fifteen. He
8352 evidently believes, like Bacon, that henceforward natural science will
8353 play a great part in education, a hope which seems hardly to have
8354 been realized, either in our own or in any former age; at any rate the
8355 fulfilment of it has been long deferred.
8356 
8357 There is a good deal of ingenuity and even originality in this work, and
8358 a most enlightened spirit pervades it. But it has little or no charm
8359 of style, and falls very far short of the 'New Atlantis' of Bacon,
8360 and still more of the 'Utopia' of Sir Thomas More. It is full of
8361 inconsistencies, and though borrowed from Plato, shows but a superficial
8362 acquaintance with his writings. It is a work such as one might expect
8363 to have been written by a philosopher and man of genius who was also a
8364 friar, and who had spent twenty-seven years of his life in a prison of
8365 the Inquisition. The most interesting feature of the book, common to
8366 Plato and Sir Thomas More, is the deep feeling which is shown by the
8367 writer, of the misery and ignorance prevailing among the lower classes
8368 in his own time. Campanella takes note of Aristotle's answer to Plato's
8369 community of property, that in a society where all things are common, no
8370 individual would have any motive to work (Arist. Pol.): he replies, that
8371 his citizens being happy and contented in themselves (they are required
8372 to work only four hours a day), will have greater regard for their
8373 fellows than exists among men at present. He thinks, like Plato, that if
8374 he abolishes private feelings and interests, a great public feeling will
8375 take their place.
8376 
8377 Other writings on ideal states, such as the 'Oceana' of Harrington, in
8378 which the Lord Archon, meaning Cromwell, is described, not as he was,
8379 but as he ought to have been; or the 'Argenis' of Barclay, which is an
8380 historical allegory of his own time, are too unlike Plato to be worth
8381 mentioning. More interesting than either of these, and far more Platonic
8382 in style and thought, is Sir John Eliot's 'Monarchy of Man,' in which
8383 the prisoner of the Tower, no longer able 'to be a politician in the
8384 land of his birth,' turns away from politics to view 'that other city
8385 which is within him,' and finds on the very threshold of the grave that
8386 the secret of human happiness is the mastery of self. The change of
8387 government in the time of the English Commonwealth set men thinking
8388 about first principles, and gave rise to many works of this class...The
8389 great original genius of Swift owes nothing to Plato; nor is there
8390 any trace in the conversation or in the works of Dr. Johnson of any
8391 acquaintance with his writings. He probably would have refuted Plato
8392 without reading him, in the same fashion in which he supposed himself to
8393 have refuted Bishop Berkeley's theory of the non-existence of matter.
8394 If we except the so-called English Platonists, or rather Neo-Platonists,
8395 who never understood their master, and the writings of Coleridge,
8396 who was to some extent a kindred spirit, Plato has left no permanent

8399 7. Human life and conduct are affected by ideals in the same way that
8400 they are affected by the examples of eminent men. Neither the one nor
8401 the other are immediately applicable to practice, but there is a virtue
8402 flowing from them which tends to raise individuals above the common
8403 routine of society or trade, and to elevate States above the mere
8404 interests of commerce or the necessities of self-defence. Like the
8405 ideals of art they are partly framed by the omission of particulars;
8406 they require to be viewed at a certain distance, and are apt to fade
8407 away if we attempt to approach them. They gain an imaginary distinctness
8408 when embodied in a State or in a system of philosophy, but they still
8409 remain the visions of 'a world unrealized.' More striking and obvious to
8410 the ordinary mind are the examples of great men, who have served their
8411 own generation and are remembered in another. Even in our own family
8412 circle there may have been some one, a woman, or even a child, in
8413 whose face has shone forth a goodness more than human. The ideal then
8414 approaches nearer to us, and we fondly cling to it. The ideal of the
8415 past, whether of our own past lives or of former states of society, has
8416 a singular fascination for the minds of many. Too late we learn that
8417 such ideals cannot be recalled, though the recollection of them may
8418 have a humanizing influence on other times. But the abstractions of
8419 philosophy are to most persons cold and vacant; they give light without
8420 warmth; they are like the full moon in the heavens when there are no
8421 stars appearing. Men cannot live by thought alone; the world of sense is
8422 always breaking in upon them. They are for the most part confined to a
8423 corner of earth, and see but a little way beyond their own home or place
8424 of abode; they 'do not lift up their eyes to the hills'; they are not
8425 awake when the dawn appears. But in Plato we have reached a height from
8426 which a man may look into the distance and behold the future of the
8427 world and of philosophy. The ideal of the State and of the life of
8428 the philosopher; the ideal of an education continuing through life and
8429 extending equally to both sexes; the ideal of the unity and correlation
8430 of knowledge; the faith in good and immortality--are the vacant forms of
8431 light on which Plato is seeking to fix the eye of mankind.
8432 
8433 8. Two other ideals, which never appeared above the horizon in Greek
8434 Philosophy, float before the minds of men in our own day: one seen more
8435 clearly than formerly, as though each year and each generation brought
8436 us nearer to some great change; the other almost in the same degree
8437 retiring from view behind the laws of nature, as if oppressed by them,
8438 but still remaining a silent hope of we know not what hidden in the
8439 heart of man. The first ideal is the future of the human race in this
8440 world; the second the future of the individual in another. The first is
8441 the more perfect realization of our own present life; the second,
8442 the abnegation of it: the one, limited by experience, the other,
8443 transcending it. Both of them have been and are powerful motives of
8444 action; there are a few in whom they have taken the place of all earthly
8445 interests. The hope of a future for the human race at first sight seems
8446 to be the more disinterested, the hope of individual existence the more
8447 egotistical, of the two motives. But when men have learned to resolve
8448 their hope of a future either for themselves or for the world into the
8449 will of God--'not my will but Thine,' the difference between them falls
8450 away; and they may be allowed to make either of them the basis of their
8451 lives, according to their own individual character or temperament. There
8452 is as much faith in the willingness to work for an unseen future in this
8453 world as in another. Neither is it inconceivable that some rare nature
8454 may feel his duty to another generation, or to another century, almost
8455 as strongly as to his own, or that living always in the presence of God,
8456 he may realize another world as vividly as he does this.
8457 
8458 The greatest of all ideals may, or rather must be conceived by us under
8459 similitudes derived from human qualities; although sometimes, like the
8460 Jewish prophets, we may dash away these figures of speech and describe
8461 the nature of God only in negatives. These again by degrees acquire a
8462 positive meaning. It would be well, if when meditating on the higher
8463 truths either of philosophy or religion, we sometimes substituted one
8464 form of expression for another, lest through the necessities of language
8465 we should become the slaves of mere words.
8466 
8467 There is a third ideal, not the same, but akin to these, which has a
8468 place in the home and heart of every believer in the religion of Christ,
8469 and in which men seem to find a nearer and more familiar truth,
8470 the Divine man, the Son of Man, the Saviour of mankind, Who is the
8471 first-born and head of the whole family in heaven and earth, in Whom
8472 the Divine and human, that which is without and that which is within the
8473 range of our earthly faculties, are indissolubly united. Neither is this
8474 divine form of goodness wholly separable from the ideal of the Christian
8475 Church, which is said in the New Testament to be 'His body,' or at
8476 variance with those other images of good which Plato sets before us. We
8477 see Him in a figure only, and of figures of speech we select but a few,
8478 and those the simplest, to be the expression of Him. We behold Him in
8479 a picture, but He is not there. We gather up the fragments of His
8480 discourses, but neither do they represent Him as He truly was. His
8481 dwelling is neither in heaven nor earth, but in the heart of man.
8482 This is that image which Plato saw dimly in the distance, which, when
8483 existing among men, he called, in the language of Homer, 'the likeness
8484 of God,' the likeness of a nature which in all ages men have felt to be
8485 greater and better than themselves, and which in endless forms, whether
8486 derived from Scripture or nature, from the witness of history or from
8487 the human heart, regarded as a person or not as a person, with or
8488 without parts or passions, existing in space or not in space, is and
8489 will always continue to be to mankind the Idea of Good.

8526 BOOK I.
8527 
8528 I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston,
8529 that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian
8530 Artemis.); and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would
8531 celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the
8532 procession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally,
8533 if not more, beautiful. When we had finished our prayers and viewed the
8534 spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant
8535 Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a
8536 distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to
8537 run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak
8538 behind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.
8539 
8540 I turned round, and asked him where his master was.
8541 
8542 There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.
8543 
8544 Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus
8545 appeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus the son
8546 of Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.
8547 
8548 Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your
8549 companion are already on your way to the city.
8550 
8551 You are not far wrong, I said.
8552 
8553 But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?
8554 
8555 Of course.
8556 
8557 And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain
8558 where you are.
8559 
8560 May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to
8561 let us go?
8562 
8563 But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.
8564 
8565 Certainly not, replied Glaucon.
8566 
8567 Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.
8568 
8569 Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in
8570 honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?
8571 
8572 With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches
8573 and pass them one to another during the race?
8574 
8575 Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be
8576 celebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon
8577 after supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young
8578 men, and we will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be perverse.
8579 
8580 Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.
8581 
8582 Very good, I replied.
8583 
8584 Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we found
8585 his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the
8586 Chalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of
8587 Aristonymus. There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I
8588 had not seen for a long time, and I thought him very much aged. He was
8589 seated on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had
8590 been sacrificing in the court; and there were some other chairs in the
8591 room arranged in a semicircle, upon which we sat down by him. He saluted
8592 me eagerly, and then he said:--
8593 
8594 You don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I were
8595 still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But
8596 at my age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come
8597 oftener to the Piraeus. For let me tell you, that the more the pleasures
8598 of the body fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm
8599 of conversation. Do not then deny my request, but make our house your
8600 resort and keep company with these young men; we are old friends, and
8601 you will be quite at home with us.
8602 
8603 I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus,
8604 than conversing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who
8605 have gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to
8606 enquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult.
8607 And this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have
8608 arrived at that time which the poets call the 'threshold of old age'--Is
8609 life harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?
8610 
8611 I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of my
8612 age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says;
8613 and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is--I cannot
8614 eat, I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away:
8615 there was a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer
8616 life. Some complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations,
8617 and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the
8618 cause. But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which
8619 is not really in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old,
8620 and every other old man, would have felt as they do. But this is not
8621 my own experience, nor that of others whom I have known. How well I
8622 remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How
8623 does love suit with age, Sophocles,--are you still the man you were?
8624 Peace, he replied; most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you
8625 speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master. His
8626 words have often occurred to my mind since, and they seem as good to
8627 me now as at the time when he uttered them. For certainly old age has
8628 a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax their hold,
8629 then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of one mad
8630 master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets,
8631 and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed to the
8632 same cause, which is not old age, but men's characters and tempers; for
8633 he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of
8634 age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are
8635 equally a burden.
8636 
8637 I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might go
8638 on--Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in general
8639 are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old
8640 age sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but
8641 because you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.
8642 
8643 You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is
8644 something in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I
8645 might answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing
8646 him and saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but because he
8647 was an Athenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours,
8648 neither of us would have been famous.' And to those who are not rich and
8649 are impatient of old age, the same reply may be made; for to the good
8650 poor man old age cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad rich man ever
8651 have peace with himself.
8652 
8653 May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part
8654 inherited or acquired by you?
8655 
8656 Acquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In the art
8657 of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather:
8658 for my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of
8659 his patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now;
8660 but my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present:
8661 and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a
8662 little more than I received.
8663 
8664 That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see that you
8665 are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather of those
8666 who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them;
8667 the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of
8668 their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems, or
8669 of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for the
8670 sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men. And hence
8671 they are very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but the
8672 praises of wealth.
8673 
8674 That is true, he said.
8675 
8676 Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question?--What do you
8677 consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your
8678 wealth?
8679 
8680 One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others.
8681 For let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near
8682 death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before;
8683 the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there
8684 of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he
8685 is tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the
8686 weakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other
8687 place, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms
8688 crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what
8689 wrongs he has done to others. And when he finds that the sum of his
8690 transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his
8691 sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings. But to him who
8692 is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as Pindar charmingly says, is the
8693 kind nurse of his age:
8694 
8695 'Hope,' he says, 'cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice
8696 and holiness, and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his
8697 journey;--hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man.'
8698 
8699 How admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, I do not
8700 say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion to
8701 deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;
8702 and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension
8703 about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to
8704 this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and
8705 therefore I say, that, setting one thing against another, of the many
8706 advantages which wealth has to give, to a man of sense this is in my
8707 opinion the greatest.
8708 
8709 Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is
8710 it?--to speak the truth and to pay your debts--no more than this? And
8711 even to this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in his
8712 right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is
8713 not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him? No one would
8714 say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than
8715 they would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in
8716 his condition.
8717 
8718 You are quite right, he replied.
8719 
8720 But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a
8721 correct definition of justice.
8722 
8723 Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said
8724 Polemarchus interposing.
8725 
8726 I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after the
8727 sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the company.
8728 
8729 Is not Polemarchus your heir? I said.
8730 
8731 To be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices.
8732 
8733 Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say, and
8734 according to you truly say, about justice?
8735 
8736 He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he
8737 appears to me to be right.
8738 
8739 I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man, but
8740 his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear to
8741 me. For he certainly does not mean, as we were just now saying, that I
8742 ought to return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks
8743 for it when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be
8744 denied to be a debt.
8745 
8746 True.
8747 
8748 Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no
8749 means to make the return?
8750 
8751 Certainly not.
8752 
8753 When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did not
8754 mean to include that case?
8755 
8756 Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a
8757 friend and never evil.
8758 
8759 You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of
8760 the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of a
8761 debt,--that is what you would imagine him to say?
8762 
8763 Yes.
8764 
8765 And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?
8766 
8767 To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an enemy,
8768 as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him--that
8769 is to say, evil.
8770 
8771 Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken
8772 darkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that justice
8773 is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he termed a
8774 debt.
8775 
8776 That must have been his meaning, he said.
8777 
8778 By heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is
8779 given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would
8780 make to us?
8781 
8782 He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to
8783 human bodies.
8784 
8785 And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?
8786 
8787 Seasoning to food.
8788 
8789 And what is that which justice gives, and to whom?
8790 
8791 If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding
8792 instances, then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil
8793 to enemies.
8794 
8795 That is his meaning then?
8796 
8797 I think so.
8798 
8799 And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies
8800 in time of sickness?
8801 
8802 The physician.
8803 
8804 Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?
8805 
8806 The pilot.
8807 
8808 And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just
8809 man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friend?
8810 
8811 In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other.
8812 
8813 But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of a
8814 physician?
8815 
8816 No.
8817 
8818 And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?
8819 
8820 No.
8821 
8822 Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?
8823 
8824 I am very far from thinking so.
8825 
8826 You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war?
8827 
8828 Yes.
8829 
8830 Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?
8831 
8832 Yes.
8833 
8834 Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes,--that is what you mean?
8835 
8836 Yes.
8837 
8838 And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of
8839 peace?
8840 
8841 In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.
8842 
8843 And by contracts you mean partnerships?
8844 
8845 Exactly.
8846 
8847 But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better
8848 partner at a game of draughts?
8849 
8850 The skilful player.
8851 
8852 And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or
8853 better partner than the builder?
8854 
8855 Quite the reverse.
8856 
8857 Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than
8858 the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a
8859 better partner than the just man?
8860 
8861 In a money partnership.
8862 
8863 Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not
8864 want a just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a
8865 horse; a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that, would
8866 he not?
8867 
8868 Certainly.
8869 
8870 And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be
8871 better?
8872 
8873 True.
8874 
8875 Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is
8876 to be preferred?
8877 
8878 When you want a deposit to be kept safely.
8879 
8880 You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?
8881 
8882 Precisely.
8883 
8884 That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?
8885 
8886 That is the inference.
8887 
8888 And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful to
8889 the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then the
8890 art of the vine-dresser?
8891 
8892 Clearly.
8893 
8894 And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, you
8895 would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then
8896 the art of the soldier or of the musician?
8897 
8898 Certainly.
8899 
8900 And so of all other things;--justice is useful when they are useless,
8901 and useless when they are useful?
8902 
8903 That is the inference.
8904 
8905 Then justice is not good for much. But let us consider this further
8906 point: Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any
8907 kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?
8908 
8909 Certainly.
8910 
8911 And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is
8912 best able to create one?
8913 
8914 True.
8915 
8916 And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march
8917 upon the enemy?
8918 
8919 Certainly.
8920 
8921 Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?
8922 
8923 That, I suppose, is to be inferred.
8924 
8925 Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing
8926 it.
8927 
8928 That is implied in the argument.
8929 
8930 Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this is
8931 a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; for he,
8932 speaking of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a
8933 favourite of his, affirms that
8934 
8935 'He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury.'
8936 
8937 And so, you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of
8938 theft; to be practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm
8939 of enemies,'--that was what you were saying?
8940 
8941 No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; but I
8942 still stand by the latter words.
8943 
8944 Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean those
8945 who are so really, or only in seeming?
8946 
8947 Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks
8948 good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.
8949 
8950 Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who are not
8951 good seem to be so, and conversely?
8952 
8953 That is true.
8954 
8955 Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their
8956 friends? True.
8957 
8958 And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil
8959 to the good?
8960 
8961 Clearly.
8962 
8963 But the good are just and would not do an injustice?
8964 
8965 True.
8966 
8967 Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no
8968 wrong?
8969 
8970 Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.
8971 
8972 Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the
8973 unjust?
8974 
8975 I like that better.
8976 
8977 But see the consequence:--Many a man who is ignorant of human nature
8978 has friends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm to
8979 them; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we
8980 shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the
8981 meaning of Simonides.
8982 
8983 Very true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an error
8984 into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and
8985 'enemy.'
8986 
8987 What was the error, Polemarchus? I asked.
8988 
8989 We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good.
8990 
8991 And how is the error to be corrected?
8992 
8993 We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems, good;
8994 and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and is not
8995 a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.
8996 
8997 You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?
8998 
8999 Yes.
9000 
9001 And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do
9002 good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It
9003 is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our
9004 enemies when they are evil?
9005 
9006 Yes, that appears to me to be the truth.
9007 
9008 But ought the just to injure any one at all?
9009 
9010 Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his
9011 enemies.
9012 
9013 When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?
9014 
9015 The latter.
9016 
9017 Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not of
9018 dogs?
9019 
9020 Yes, of horses.
9021 
9022 And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of
9023 horses?
9024 
9025 Of course.
9026 
9027 And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the
9028 proper virtue of man?
9029 
9030 Certainly.
9031 
9032 And that human virtue is justice?
9033 
9034 To be sure.
9035 
9036 Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?
9037 
9038 That is the result.
9039 
9040 But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?
9041 
9042 Certainly not.
9043 
9044 Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?
9045 
9046 Impossible.
9047 
9048 And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking generally, can
9049 the good by virtue make them bad?
9050 
9051 Assuredly not.
9052 
9053 Any more than heat can produce cold?
9054 
9055 It cannot.
9056 
9057 Or drought moisture?
9058 
9059 Clearly not.
9060 
9061 Nor can the good harm any one?
9062 
9063 Impossible.
9064 
9065 And the just is the good?
9066 
9067 Certainly.
9068 
9069 Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man,
9070 but of the opposite, who is the unjust?
9071 
9072 I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.
9073 
9074 Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts, and
9075 that good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends, and evil the
9076 debt which he owes to his enemies,--to say this is not wise; for it is
9077 not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be
9078 in no case just.
9079 
9080 I agree with you, said Polemarchus.
9081 
9082 Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who
9083 attributes such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other
9084 wise man or seer?
9085 
9086 I am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.
9087 
9088 Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?
9089 
9090 Whose?
9091 
9092 I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban,
9093 or some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own
9094 power, was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends
9095 and harm to your enemies.'
9096 
9097 Most true, he said.
9098 
9099 Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what
9100 other can be offered?
9101 
9102 Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made an
9103 attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down
9104 by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. But when
9105 Polemarchus and I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no
9106 longer hold his peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a
9107 wild beast, seeking to devour us. We were quite panic-stricken at the
9108 sight of him.
9109 
9110 He roared out to the whole company: What folly, Socrates, has taken
9111 possession of you all? And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to
9112 one another? I say that if you want really to know what justice is,
9113 you should not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to
9114 yourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer;
9115 for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer. And now I will
9116 not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain
9117 or interest, for this sort of nonsense will not do for me; I must have
9118 clearness and accuracy.
9119 
9120 I was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without
9121 trembling. Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him, I
9122 should have been struck dumb: but when I saw his fury rising, I looked
9123 at him first, and was therefore able to reply to him.
9124 
9125 Thrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don't be hard upon us. Polemarchus
9126 and I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but I
9127 can assure you that the error was not intentional. If we were seeking
9128 for a piece of gold, you would not imagine that we were 'knocking under
9129 to one another,' and so losing our chance of finding it. And why, when
9130 we are seeking for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of
9131 gold, do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not
9132 doing our utmost to get at the truth? Nay, my good friend, we are most
9133 willing and anxious to do so, but the fact is that we cannot. And if so,
9134 you people who know all things should pity us and not be angry with us.
9135 
9136 How characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh;--that's
9137 your ironical style! Did I not foresee--have I not already told you,
9138 that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony or
9139 any other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?
9140 
9141 You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that if
9142 you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit
9143 him whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six
9144 times two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do
9145 for me,'--then obviously, if that is your way of putting the
9146 question, no one can answer you. But suppose that he were to retort,
9147 'Thrasymachus, what do you mean? If one of these numbers which you
9148 interdict be the true answer to the question, am I falsely to say some
9149 other number which is not the right one?--is that your meaning?'--How
9150 would you answer him?
9151 
9152 Just as if the two cases were at all alike! he said.
9153 
9154 Why should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, but only
9155 appear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he
9156 thinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?
9157 
9158 I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted
9159 answers?
9160 
9161 I dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection I
9162 approve of any of them.
9163 
9164 But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better, he
9165 said, than any of these? What do you deserve to have done to you?
9166 
9167 Done to me!--as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the wise--that
9168 is what I deserve to have done to me.
9169 
9170 What, and no payment! a pleasant notion!
9171 
9172 I will pay when I have the money, I replied.
9173 
9174 But you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, need be
9175 under no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for
9176 Socrates.
9177 
9178 Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does--refuse to
9179 answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one else.
9180 
9181 Why, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, and says
9182 that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint notions
9183 of his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them? The
9184 natural thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself
9185 who professes to know and can tell what he knows. Will you then kindly
9186 answer, for the edification of the company and of myself?
9187 
9188 Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request, and
9189 Thrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak;
9190 for he thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish
9191 himself. But at first he affected to insist on my answering; at length
9192 he consented to begin. Behold, he said, the wisdom of Socrates; he
9193 refuses to teach himself, and goes about learning of others, to whom he
9194 never even says Thank you.
9195 
9196 That I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am
9197 ungrateful I wholly deny. Money I have none, and therefore I pay in
9198 praise, which is all I have; and how ready I am to praise any one who
9199 appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer;
9200 for I expect that you will answer well.
9201 
9202 Listen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else than
9203 the interest of the stronger. And now why do you not praise me? But of
9204 course you won't.
9205 
9206 Let me first understand you, I replied. Justice, as you say, is the
9207 interest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?
9208 You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is
9209 stronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his
9210 bodily strength, that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who
9211 are weaker than he is, and right and just for us?
9212 
9213 That's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense
9214 which is most damaging to the argument.
9215 
9216 Not at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them; and I
9217 wish that you would be a little clearer.
9218 
9219 Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ;
9220 there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are
9221 aristocracies?
9222 
9223 Yes, I know.
9224 
9225 And the government is the ruling power in each state?
9226 
9227 Certainly.
9228 
9229 And the different forms of government make laws democratical,
9230 aristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests;
9231 and these laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the
9232 justice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses
9233 them they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. And that is what
9234 I mean when I say that in all states there is the same principle of
9235 justice, which is the interest of the government; and as the government
9236 must be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that
9237 everywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of
9238 the stronger.
9239 
9240 Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not I will
9241 try to discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you have
9242 yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. It is
9243 true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are
9244 added.
9245 
9246 A small addition, you must allow, he said.
9247 
9248 Great or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether
9249 what you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice
9250 is interest of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger'; about
9251 this addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider further.
9252 
9253 Proceed.
9254 
9255 I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just for subjects to
9256 obey their rulers?
9257 
9258 I do.
9259 
9260 But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they
9261 sometimes liable to err?
9262 
9263 To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.
9264 
9265 Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and
9266 sometimes not?
9267 
9268 True.
9269 
9270 When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest;
9271 when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit that?
9272 
9273 Yes.
9274 
9275 And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects,--and that
9276 is what you call justice?
9277 
9278 Doubtless.
9279 
9280 Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to the
9281 interest of the stronger but the reverse?
9282 
9283 What is that you are saying? he asked.
9284 
9285 I am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us consider:
9286 Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own
9287 interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice?
9288 Has not that been admitted?
9289 
9290 Yes.
9291 
9292 Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest
9293 of the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be
9294 done which are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice is the
9295 obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O
9296 wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker
9297 are commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the
9298 injury of the stronger?
9299 
9300 Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.
9301 
9302 Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his witness.
9303 
9304 But there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus
9305 himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for
9306 their own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.
9307 
9308 Yes, Polemarchus,--Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was
9309 commanded by their rulers is just.
9310 
9311 Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of the
9312 stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further
9313 acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his
9314 subjects to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that
9315 justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.
9316 
9317 But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what the
9318 stronger thought to be his interest,--this was what the weaker had to
9319 do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.
9320 
9321 Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.
9322 
9323 Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept his
9324 statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what
9325 the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?
9326 
9327 Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken
9328 the stronger at the time when he is mistaken?
9329 
9330 Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that
9331 the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.
9332 
9333 You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, that he
9334 who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?
9335 or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or
9336 grammarian at the time when he is making the mistake, in respect of the
9337 mistake? True, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian
9338 has made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is
9339 that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a
9340 mistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them
9341 err unless their skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled
9342 artists. No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what
9343 his name implies; though he is commonly said to err, and I adopted the
9344 common mode of speaking. But to be perfectly accurate, since you are
9345 such a lover of accuracy, we should say that the ruler, in so far as he
9346 is a ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring, always commands that which
9347 is for his own interest; and the subject is required to execute his
9348 commands; and therefore, as I said at first and now repeat, justice is
9349 the interest of the stronger.
9350 
9351 Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like an
9352 informer?
9353 
9354 Certainly, he replied.
9355 
9356 And do you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of
9357 injuring you in the argument?
9358 
9359 Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word--I know it; but you will be
9360 found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.
9361 
9362 I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any
9363 misunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what
9364 sense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were
9365 saying, he being the superior, it is just that the inferior should
9366 execute--is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the
9367 term?
9368 
9369 In the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play the
9370 informer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never will
9371 be able, never.
9372 
9373 And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and cheat,
9374 Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.
9375 
9376 Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.
9377 
9378 Enough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should ask
9379 you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which
9380 you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? And remember
9381 that I am now speaking of the true physician.
9382 
9383 A healer of the sick, he replied.
9384 
9385 And the pilot--that is to say, the true pilot--is he a captain of
9386 sailors or a mere sailor?
9387 
9388 A captain of sailors.
9389 
9390 The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into
9391 account; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which he
9392 is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant of
9393 his skill and of his authority over the sailors.
9394 
9395 Very true, he said.
9396 
9397 Now, I said, every art has an interest?
9398 
9399 Certainly.
9400 
9401 For which the art has to consider and provide?
9402 
9403 Yes, that is the aim of art.
9404 
9405 And the interest of any art is the perfection of it--this and nothing
9406 else?
9407 
9408 What do you mean?
9409 
9410 I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.
9411 Suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has
9412 wants, I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body may
9413 be ill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which
9414 the art of medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention of
9415 medicine, as you will acknowledge. Am I not right?
9416 
9417 Quite right, he replied.
9418 
9419 But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any
9420 quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the
9421 ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide
9422 for the interests of seeing and hearing--has art in itself, I say, any
9423 similar liability to fault or defect, and does every art require another
9424 supplementary art to provide for its interests, and that another and
9425 another without end? Or have the arts to look only after their
9426 own interests? Or have they no need either of themselves or of
9427 another?--having no faults or defects, they have no need to correct
9428 them, either by the exercise of their own art or of any other; they have
9429 only to consider the interest of their subject-matter. For every art
9430 remains pure and faultless while remaining true--that is to say, while
9431 perfect and unimpaired. Take the words in your precise sense, and tell
9432 me whether I am not right.
9433 
9434 Yes, clearly.
9435 
9436 Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the
9437 interest of the body?
9438 
9439 True, he said.
9440 
9441 Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of
9442 horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts
9443 care for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that
9444 which is the subject of their art?
9445 
9446 True, he said.
9447 
9448 But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of their
9449 own subjects?
9450 
9451 To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.
9452 
9453 Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the
9454 stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and weaker?
9455 
9456 He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally
9457 acquiesced.
9458 
9459 Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician,
9460 considers his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his
9461 patient; for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as
9462 a subject, and is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?
9463 
9464 Yes.
9465 
9466 And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler of
9467 sailors and not a mere sailor?
9468 
9469 That has been admitted.
9470 
9471 And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest
9472 of the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's
9473 interest?
9474 
9475 He gave a reluctant 'Yes.'
9476 
9477 Then, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so far
9478 as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest, but
9479 always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art;
9480 to that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which he
9481 says and does.
9482 
9483 When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw that
9484 the definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus,
9485 instead of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a
9486 nurse?
9487 
9488 Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be
9489 answering?
9490 
9491 Because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she has not
9492 even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.
9493 
9494 What makes you say that? I replied.
9495 
9496 Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens or tends the
9497 sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of
9498 himself or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of
9499 states, if they are true rulers, never think of their subjects as sheep,
9500 and that they are not studying their own advantage day and night. Oh,
9501 no; and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the just and
9502 unjust as not even to know that justice and the just are in reality
9503 another's good; that is to say, the interest of the ruler and stronger,
9504 and the loss of the subject and servant; and injustice the opposite; for
9505 the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just: he is the stronger,
9506 and his subjects do what is for his interest, and minister to his
9507 happiness, which is very far from being their own. Consider further,
9508 most foolish Socrates, that the just is always a loser in comparison
9509 with the unjust. First of all, in private contracts: wherever the unjust
9510 is the partner of the just you will find that, when the partnership is
9511 dissolved, the unjust man has always more and the just less. Secondly,
9512 in their dealings with the State: when there is an income-tax, the just
9513 man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount of income;
9514 and when there is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the
9515 other much. Observe also what happens when they take an office; there is
9516 the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses,
9517 and getting nothing out of the public, because he is just; moreover he
9518 is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in
9519 unlawful ways. But all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man.
9520 I am speaking, as before, of injustice on a large scale in which the
9521 advantage of the unjust is most apparent; and my meaning will be most
9522 clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the
9523 criminal is the happiest of men, and the sufferers or those who refuse
9524 to do injustice are the most miserable--that is to say tyranny, which by
9525 fraud and force takes away the property of others, not little by little
9526 but wholesale; comprehending in one, things sacred as well as profane,
9527 private and public; for which acts of wrong, if he were detected
9528 perpetrating any one of them singly, he would be punished and incur
9529 great disgrace--they who do such wrong in particular cases are called
9530 robbers of temples, and man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and
9531 thieves. But when a man besides taking away the money of the citizens
9532 has made slaves of them, then, instead of these names of reproach, he is
9533 termed happy and blessed, not only by the citizens but by all who
9534 hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice. For mankind
9535 censure injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of it and not
9536 because they shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have shown,
9537 Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more strength and
9538 freedom and mastery than justice; and, as I said at first, justice is
9539 the interest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit
9540 and interest.
9541 
9542 Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bath-man, deluged
9543 our ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company
9544 would not let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his
9545 position; and I myself added my own humble request that he would not
9546 leave us. Thrasymachus, I said to him, excellent man, how suggestive
9547 are your remarks! And are you going to run away before you have fairly
9548 taught or learned whether they are true or not? Is the attempt to
9549 determine the way of man's life so small a matter in your eyes--to
9550 determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest
9551 advantage?
9552 
9553 And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?
9554 
9555 You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us,
9556 Thrasymachus--whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you
9557 say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. Prithee, friend,
9558 do not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any
9559 benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own
9560 part I openly declare that I am not convinced, and that I do not believe
9561 injustice to be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled and
9562 allowed to have free play. For, granting that there may be an unjust
9563 man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force, still this
9564 does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice, and there
9565 may be others who are in the same predicament with myself. Perhaps we
9566 may be wrong; if so, you in your wisdom should convince us that we are
9567 mistaken in preferring justice to injustice.
9568 
9569 And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced
9570 by what I have just said; what more can I do for you? Would you have me
9571 put the proof bodily into your souls?
9572 
9573 Heaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, if you
9574 change, change openly and let there be no deception. For I must remark,
9575 Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that although
9576 you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you did not
9577 observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought that
9578 the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own
9579 good, but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to the pleasures
9580 of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the market, and not as
9581 a shepherd. Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with
9582 the good of his subjects; he has only to provide the best for them,
9583 since the perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the
9584 requirements of it are satisfied. And that was what I was saying just
9585 now about the ruler. I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered
9586 as ruler, whether in a state or in private life, could only regard the
9587 good of his flock or subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers
9588 in states, that is to say, the true rulers, like being in authority.
9589 
9590 Think! Nay, I am sure of it.
9591 
9592 Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly
9593 without payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the
9594 advantage not of themselves but of others? Let me ask you a question:
9595 Are not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a
9596 separate function? And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you
9597 think, that we may make a little progress.
9598 
9599 Yes, that is the difference, he replied.
9600 
9601 And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general
9602 one--medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea,
9603 and so on?
9604 
9605 Yes, he said.
9606 
9607 And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but we do
9608 not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot is
9609 to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the pilot
9610 may be improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined to say, would
9611 you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt
9612 your exact use of language?
9613 
9614 Certainly not.
9615 
9616 Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not
9617 say that the art of payment is medicine?
9618 
9619 I should not.
9620 
9621 Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a
9622 man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?
9623 
9624 Certainly not.
9625 
9626 And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially
9627 confined to the art?
9628 
9629 Yes.
9630 
9631 Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is to
9632 be attributed to something of which they all have the common use?
9633 
9634 True, he replied.
9635 
9636 And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is
9637 gained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art
9638 professed by him?
9639 
9640 He gave a reluctant assent to this.
9641 
9642 Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective
9643 arts. But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives health, and
9644 the art of the builder builds a house, another art attends them which
9645 is the art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own business and
9646 benefiting that over which they preside, but would the artist receive
9647 any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?
9648 
9649 I suppose not.
9650 
9651 But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?
9652 
9653 Certainly, he confers a benefit.
9654 
9655 Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts
9656 nor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before
9657 saying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who
9658 are the weaker and not the stronger--to their good they attend and
9659 not to the good of the superior. And this is the reason, my dear
9660 Thrasymachus, why, as I was just now saying, no one is willing to
9661 govern; because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils
9662 which are not his concern without remuneration. For, in the execution of
9663 his work, and in giving his orders to another, the true artist does not
9664 regard his own interest, but always that of his subjects; and therefore
9665 in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they must be paid in one of
9666 three modes of payment, money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing.
9667 
9668 What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of payment
9669 are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not understand, or
9670 how a penalty can be a payment.
9671 
9672 You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to
9673 the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know that
9674 ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?
9675 
9676 Very true.
9677 
9678 And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for
9679 them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing
9680 and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves
9681 out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being
9682 ambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be
9683 laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of
9684 punishment. And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness
9685 to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed
9686 dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
9687 refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.
9688 And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,
9689 not because they would, but because they cannot help--not under the idea
9690 that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as
9691 a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling
9692 to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good. For there
9693 is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men,
9694 then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to
9695 obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that the
9696 true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, but that
9697 of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to
9698 receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring
9699 one. So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the
9700 interest of the stronger. This latter question need not be further
9701 discussed at present; but when Thrasymachus says that the life of the
9702 unjust is more advantageous than that of the just, his new statement
9703 appears to me to be of a far more serious character. Which of us has
9704 spoken truly? And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?
9705 
9706 I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, he
9707 answered.
9708 
9709 Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was
9710 rehearsing?
9711 
9712 Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.
9713 
9714 Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that he
9715 is saying what is not true?
9716 
9717 Most certainly, he replied.
9718 
9719 If, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the
9720 advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must be a
9721 numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side,
9722 and in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed in our
9723 enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to one another, we shall
9724 unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.
9725 
9726 Very good, he said.
9727 
9728 And which method do I understand you to prefer? I said.
9729 
9730 That which you propose.
9731 
9732 Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning and
9733 answer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect
9734 justice?
9735 
9736 Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.
9737 
9738 And what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue and
9739 the other vice?
9740 
9741 Certainly.
9742 
9743 I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?
9744 
9745 What a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice to
9746 be profitable and justice not.
9747 
9748 What else then would you say?
9749 
9750 The opposite, he replied.
9751 
9752 And would you call justice vice?
9753 
9754 No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.
9755 
9756 Then would you call injustice malignity?
9757 
9758 No; I would rather say discretion.
9759 
9760 And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?
9761 
9762 Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly
9763 unjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but
9764 perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses. Even this profession
9765 if undetected has advantages, though they are not to be compared with
9766 those of which I was just now speaking.
9767 
9768 I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, I
9769 replied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class
9770 injustice with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.
9771 
9772 Certainly I do so class them.
9773 
9774 Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground;
9775 for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had
9776 been admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer
9777 might have been given to you on received principles; but now I perceive
9778 that you will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust
9779 you will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before
9780 to the just, seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with
9781 wisdom and virtue.
9782 
9783 You have guessed most infallibly, he replied.
9784 
9785 Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the
9786 argument so long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are
9787 speaking your real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest
9788 and are not amusing yourself at our expense.
9789 
9790 I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?--to refute the
9791 argument is your business.
9792 
9793 Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so good
9794 as answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any
9795 advantage over the just?
9796 
9797 Far otherwise; if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature
9798 which he is.
9799 
9800 And would he try to go beyond just action?
9801 
9802 He would not.
9803 
9804 And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the
9805 unjust; would that be considered by him as just or unjust?
9806 
9807 He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he
9808 would not be able.
9809 
9810 Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point. My
9811 question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than
9812 another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?
9813 
9814 Yes, he would.
9815 
9816 And what of the unjust--does he claim to have more than the just man and
9817 to do more than is just?
9818 
9819 Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.
9820 
9821 And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the
9822 unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?
9823 
9824 True.
9825 
9826 We may put the matter thus, I said--the just does not desire more than
9827 his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than
9828 both his like and his unlike?
9829 
9830 Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.
9831 
9832 And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?
9833 
9834 Good again, he said.
9835 
9836 And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?
9837 
9838 Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who are
9839 of a certain nature; he who is not, not.
9840 
9841 Each of them, I said, is such as his like is?
9842 
9843 Certainly, he replied.
9844 
9845 Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts:
9846 you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician?
9847 
9848 Yes.
9849 
9850 And which is wise and which is foolish?
9851 
9852 Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.
9853 
9854 And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is
9855 foolish?
9856 
9857 Yes.
9858 
9859 And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?
9860 
9861 Yes.
9862 
9863 And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts
9864 the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the
9865 tightening and loosening the strings?
9866 
9867 I do not think that he would.
9868 
9869 But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?
9870 
9871 Of course.
9872 
9873 And what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and drinks
9874 would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of
9875 medicine?
9876 
9877 He would not.
9878 
9879 But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?
9880 
9881 Yes.
9882 
9883 And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think that
9884 any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying
9885 or doing more than another man who has knowledge. Would he not rather
9886 say or do the same as his like in the same case?
9887 
9888 That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.
9889 
9890 And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either
9891 the knowing or the ignorant?
9892 
9893 I dare say.
9894 
9895 And the knowing is wise?
9896 
9897 Yes.
9898 
9899 And the wise is good?
9900 
9901 True.
9902 
9903 Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, but
9904 more than his unlike and opposite?
9905 
9906 I suppose so.
9907 
9908 Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?
9909 
9910 Yes.
9911 
9912 But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both his
9913 like and unlike? Were not these your words?
9914 
9915 They were.
9916 
9917 And you also said that the just will not go beyond his like but his
9918 unlike?
9919 
9920 Yes.
9921 
9922 Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil
9923 and ignorant?
9924 
9925 That is the inference.
9926 
9927 And each of them is such as his like is?
9928 
9929 That was admitted.
9930 
9931 Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and
9932 ignorant.
9933 
9934 Thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as I repeat
9935 them, but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's day, and the
9936 perspiration poured from him in torrents; and then I saw what I had
9937 never seen before, Thrasymachus blushing. As we were now agreed that
9938 justice was virtue and wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, I
9939 proceeded to another point:
9940 
9941 Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we not
9942 also saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?
9943 
9944 Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you
9945 are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be
9946 quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to
9947 have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer
9948 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes'
9949 and 'No.'
9950 
9951 Certainly not, I said, if contrary to your real opinion.
9952 
9953 Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak.
9954 What else would you have?
9955 
9956 Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will ask and
9957 you shall answer.
9958 
9959 Proceed.
9960 
9961 Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order that
9962 our examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be
9963 carried on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is stronger
9964 and more powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified
9965 with wisdom and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice,
9966 if injustice is ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one.
9967 But I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You
9968 would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting
9969 to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them, and may be
9970 holding many of them in subjection?
9971 
9972 True, he replied; and I will add that the best and most perfectly unjust
9973 state will be most likely to do so.
9974 
9975 I know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further
9976 consider is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior state
9977 can exist or be exercised without justice or only with justice.
9978 
9979 If you are right in your view, and justice is wisdom, then only with
9980 justice; but if I am right, then without justice.
9981 
9982 I am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent and
9983 dissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.
9984 
9985 That is out of civility to you, he replied.
9986 
9987 You are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to
9988 inform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of
9989 robbers and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if
9990 they injured one another?
9991 
9992 No indeed, he said, they could not.
9993 
9994 But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act
9995 together better?
9996 
9997 Yes.
9998 
9999 And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and
10000 fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true,
10001 Thrasymachus?
10002 
10003 I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with you.
10004 
10005 How good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether
10006 injustice, having this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing,
10007 among slaves or among freemen, will not make them hate one another and
10008 set them at variance and render them incapable of common action?
10009 
10010 Certainly.
10011 
10012 And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and
10013 fight, and become enemies to one another and to the just?
10014 
10015 They will.
10016 
10017 And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom say
10018 that she loses or that she retains her natural power?
10019 
10020 Let us assume that she retains her power.
10021 
10022 Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that
10023 wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a
10024 family, or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered
10025 incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and
10026 does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes
10027 it, and with the just? Is not this the case?
10028 
10029 Yes, certainly.
10030 
10031 And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; in
10032 the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not
10033 at unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to
10034 himself and the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus?
10035 
10036 Yes.
10037 
10038 And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?
10039 
10040 Granted that they are.
10041 
10042 But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will
10043 be their friend?
10044 
10045 Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will not
10046 oppose you, lest I should displease the company.
10047 
10048 Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder of
10049 my repast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser and
10050 better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable of
10051 common action; nay more, that to speak as we did of men who are evil
10052 acting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for
10053 if they had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one
10054 another; but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of
10055 justice in them, which enabled them to combine; if there had not been
10056 they would have injured one another as well as their victims; they
10057 were but half-villains in their enterprises; for had they been whole
10058 villains, and utterly unjust, they would have been utterly incapable of
10059 action. That, as I believe, is the truth of the matter, and not what you
10060 said at first. But whether the just have a better and happier life than
10061 the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider. I
10062 think that they have, and for the reasons which I have given; but still
10063 I should like to examine further, for no light matter is at stake,
10064 nothing less than the rule of human life.
10065 
10066 Proceed.
10067 
10068 I will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse has
10069 some end?
10070 
10071 I should.
10072 
10073 And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could
10074 not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?
10075 
10076 I do not understand, he said.
10077 
10078 Let me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?
10079 
10080 Certainly not.
10081 
10082 Or hear, except with the ear?
10083 
10084 No.
10085 
10086 These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?
10087 
10088 They may.
10089 
10090 But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and in
10091 many other ways?
10092 
10093 Of course.
10094 
10095 And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?
10096 
10097 True.
10098 
10099 May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?
10100 
10101 We may.
10102 
10103 Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning
10104 when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that
10105 which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any
10106 other thing?
10107 
10108 I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.
10109 
10110 And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need I ask
10111 again whether the eye has an end?
10112 
10113 It has.
10114 
10115 And has not the eye an excellence?
10116 
10117 Yes.
10118 
10119 And the ear has an end and an excellence also?
10120 
10121 True.
10122 
10123 And the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an end
10124 and a special excellence?
10125 
10126 That is so.
10127 
10128 Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their own
10129 proper excellence and have a defect instead?
10130 
10131 How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?
10132 
10133 You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is
10134 sight; but I have not arrived at that point yet. I would rather ask
10135 the question more generally, and only enquire whether the things which
10136 fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fail
10137 of fulfilling them by their own defect?
10138 
10139 Certainly, he replied.
10140 
10141 I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper
10142 excellence they cannot fulfil their end?
10143 
10144 True.
10145 
10146 And the same observation will apply to all other things?
10147 
10148 I agree.
10149 
10150 Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for
10151 example, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. Are not
10152 these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to
10153 any other?
10154 
10155 To no other.
10156 
10157 And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?
10158 
10159 Assuredly, he said.
10160 
10161 And has not the soul an excellence also?
10162 
10163 Yes.
10164 
10165 And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that
10166 excellence?
10167 
10168 She cannot.
10169 
10170 Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent,
10171 and the good soul a good ruler?
10172 
10173 Yes, necessarily.
10174 
10175 And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and
10176 injustice the defect of the soul?
10177 
10178 That has been admitted.
10179 
10180 Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man
10181 will live ill?
10182 
10183 That is what your argument proves.
10184 
10185 And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the
10186 reverse of happy?
10187 
10188 Certainly.
10189 
10190 Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?
10191 
10192 So be it.
10193 
10194 But happiness and not misery is profitable.
10195 
10196 Of course.
10197 
10198 Then, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable
10199 than justice.
10200 
10201 Let this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the Bendidea.
10202 
10203 For which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle
10204 towards me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, I have not been
10205 well entertained; but that was my own fault and not yours. As an epicure
10206 snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table,
10207 he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so have I
10208 gone from one subject to another without having discovered what I sought
10209 at first, the nature of justice. I left that enquiry and turned away
10210 to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly; and
10211 when there arose a further question about the comparative advantages of
10212 justice and injustice, I could not refrain from passing on to that. And
10213 the result of the whole discussion has been that I know nothing at all.
10214 For I know not what justice is, and therefore I am not likely to know
10215 whether it is or is not a virtue, nor can I say whether the just man is
10216 happy or unhappy.
10217 
10218 
10219 
10220 
10221 BOOK II.
10222 
10223 With these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the
10224 discussion; but the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For
10225 Glaucon, who is always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at
10226 Thrasymachus' retirement; he wanted to have the battle out. So he said
10227 to me: Socrates, do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to
10228 have persuaded us, that to be just is always better than to be unjust?
10229 
10230 I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.
10231 
10232 Then you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now:--How would
10233 you arrange goods--are there not some which we welcome for their
10234 own sakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for example,
10235 harmless pleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time,
10236 although nothing follows from them?
10237 
10238 I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I replied.
10239 
10240 Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,
10241 health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their
10242 results?
10243 
10244 Certainly, I said.
10245 
10246 And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the
10247 care of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of
10248 money-making--these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and
10249 no one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of
10250 some reward or result which flows from them?
10251 
10252 There is, I said, this third class also. But why do you ask?
10253 
10254 Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place
10255 justice?
10256 
10257 In the highest class, I replied,--among those goods which he who would
10258 be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their
10259 results.
10260 
10261 Then the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to be
10262 reckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued
10263 for the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are
10264 disagreeable and rather to be avoided.
10265 
10266 I know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that this was
10267 the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he censured
10268 justice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be convinced by
10269 him.
10270 
10271 I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then I shall
10272 see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like a snake,
10273 to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been;
10274 but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been
10275 made clear. Setting aside their rewards and results, I want to know what
10276 they are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the soul. If you,
10277 please, then, I will revive the argument of Thrasymachus. And first I
10278 will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common
10279 view of them. Secondly, I will show that all men who practise justice do
10280 so against their will, of necessity, but not as a good. And thirdly, I
10281 will argue that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust
10282 is after all better far than the life of the just--if what they say
10283 is true, Socrates, since I myself am not of their opinion. But still I
10284 acknowledge that I am perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus
10285 and myriads of others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have
10286 never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by
10287 any one in a satisfactory way. I want to hear justice praised in respect
10288 of itself; then I shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom
10289 I think that I am most likely to hear this; and therefore I will praise
10290 the unjust life to the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking
10291 will indicate the manner in which I desire to hear you too praising
10292 justice and censuring injustice. Will you say whether you approve of my
10293 proposal?
10294 
10295 Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense
10296 would oftener wish to converse.
10297 
10298 I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin by
10299 speaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of justice.
10300 
10301 They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,
10302 evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have
10303 both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not
10304 being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they
10305 had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise
10306 laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed
10307 by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of
10308 justice;--it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is
10309 to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to
10310 suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at
10311 a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as
10312 the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do
10313 injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit
10314 to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he
10315 did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of
10316 justice.
10317 
10318 Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they
10319 have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something
10320 of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do
10321 what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them;
10322 then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be
10323 proceeding along the same road, following their interest, which all
10324 natures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the path of
10325 justice by the force of law. The liberty which we are supposing may be
10326 most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said
10327 to have been possessed by Gyges, the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian.
10328 According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in the service of
10329 the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made an
10330 opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. Amazed
10331 at the sight, he descended into the opening, where, among other marvels,
10332 he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors, at which he stooping and
10333 looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him, more than
10334 human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he took from the
10335 finger of the dead and reascended. Now the shepherds met together,
10336 according to custom, that they might send their monthly report about the
10337 flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring on his
10338 finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet
10339 of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible to the
10340 rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no
10341 longer present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring
10342 he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials
10343 of the ring, and always with the same result--when he turned the collet
10344 inwards he became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he
10345 contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court;
10346 whereas soon as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help
10347 conspired against the king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose
10348 now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of
10349 them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an
10350 iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his
10351 hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he
10352 liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any one at
10353 his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all
10354 respects be like a God among men. Then the actions of the just would be
10355 as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same
10356 point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is
10357 just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him
10358 individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he
10359 can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in their
10360 hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than
10361 justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they
10362 are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming
10363 invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he
10364 would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although
10365 they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances
10366 with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.
10367 Enough of this.
10368 
10369 Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and
10370 unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the
10371 isolation to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely
10372 unjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from
10373 either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work
10374 of their respective lives. First, let the unjust be like other
10375 distinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician, who
10376 knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits, and who,
10377 if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself. So let the unjust
10378 make his unjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he means
10379 to be great in his injustice: (he who is found out is nobody:) for
10380 the highest reach of injustice is, to be deemed just when you are not.
10381 Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most
10382 perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction, but we must allow
10383 him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired the greatest
10384 reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step he must be able to
10385 recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if any of his
10386 deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is required
10387 by his courage and strength, and command of money and friends. And at
10388 his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity,
10389 wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. There must be no
10390 seeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and
10391 then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or
10392 for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in
10393 justice only, and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a
10394 state of life the opposite of the former. Let him be the best of men,
10395 and let him be thought the worst; then he will have been put to the
10396 proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of
10397 infamy and its consequences. And let him continue thus to the hour of
10398 death; being just and seeming to be unjust. When both have reached the
10399 uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of injustice, let
10400 judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two.
10401 
10402 Heavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish them
10403 up for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were two
10404 statues.
10405 
10406 I do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like there
10407 is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either
10408 of them. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the
10409 description a little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that
10410 the words which follow are not mine.--Let me put them into the mouths of
10411 the eulogists of injustice: They will tell you that the just man who is
10412 thought unjust will be scourged, racked, bound--will have his eyes
10413 burnt out; and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be
10414 impaled: Then he will understand that he ought to seem only, and not to
10415 be, just; the words of Aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust
10416 than of the just. For the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not live
10417 with a view to appearances--he wants to be really unjust and not to seem
10418 only:--
10419 
10420 'His mind has a soil deep and fertile, Out of which spring his prudent
10421 counsels.'
10422 
10423 In the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the
10424 city; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he
10425 will; also he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own
10426 advantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice; and at every
10427 contest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his
10428 antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his
10429 gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he
10430 can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and
10431 magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to
10432 honour in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely
10433 to be dearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men
10434 are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life
10435 of the just.
10436 
10437 I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus, his
10438 brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there is
10439 nothing more to be urged?
10440 
10441 Why, what else is there? I answered.
10442 
10443 The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.
10444 
10445 Well, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother'--if
10446 he fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that
10447 Glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take
10448 from me the power of helping justice.
10449 
10450 Nonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is another
10451 side to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice
10452 and injustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what I
10453 believe to be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their
10454 sons and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake
10455 of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of
10456 obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages,
10457 and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing
10458 to the unjust from the reputation of justice. More, however, is made of
10459 appearances by this class of persons than by the others; for they
10460 throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will tell you of a shower of
10461 benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain upon the pious; and this
10462 accords with the testimony of the noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of
10463 whom says, that the gods make the oaks of the just--
10464 
10465    'To bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle;
10466    And the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces,'
10467 
10468 and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And Homer
10469 has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is--
10470 
10471 'As the fame of some blameless king who, like a god, Maintains justice;
10472 to whom the black earth brings forth Wheat and barley, whose trees are
10473 bowed with fruit, And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives
10474 him fish.'
10475 
10476 Still grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son
10477 vouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the world below, where
10478 they have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk,
10479 crowned with garlands; their idea seems to be that an immortality of
10480 drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue. Some extend their rewards
10481 yet further; the posterity, as they say, of the faithful and just shall
10482 survive to the third and fourth generation. This is the style in which
10483 they praise justice. But about the wicked there is another strain; they
10484 bury them in a slough in Hades, and make them carry water in a sieve;
10485 also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy, and inflict
10486 upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the portion of the
10487 just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does their invention
10488 supply. Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the
10489 other.
10490 
10491 Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of speaking
10492 about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, but
10493 is found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always
10494 declaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and
10495 toilsome; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of
10496 attainment, and are only censured by law and opinion. They say also that
10497 honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they
10498 are quite ready to call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in
10499 public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential,
10500 while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor, even
10501 though acknowledging them to be better than the others. But most
10502 extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the
10503 gods: they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good
10504 men, and good and happiness to the wicked. And mendicant prophets go to
10505 rich men's doors and persuade them that they have a power committed
10506 to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man's own or his
10507 ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings and feasts; and
10508 they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust, at a small cost;
10509 with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they say, to execute
10510 their will. And the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal, now
10511 smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod;--
10512 
10513 'Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth and her
10514 dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil,'
10515 
10516 and a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that the
10517 gods may be influenced by men; for he also says:--
10518 
10519 'The gods, too, may be turned from their purpose; and men pray to them
10520 and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by
10521 libations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed.'
10522 
10523 And they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus,
10524 who were children of the Moon and the Muses--that is what they
10525 say--according to which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only
10526 individuals, but whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin
10527 may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and
10528 are equally at the service of the living and the dead; the latter sort
10529 they call mysteries, and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if
10530 we neglect them no one knows what awaits us.
10531 
10532 He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and
10533 vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds
10534 likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean, who are
10535 quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from
10536 all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of
10537 persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would
10538 make the best of life? Probably the youth will say to himself in the
10539 words of Pindar--
10540 
10541 'Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower
10542 which may be a fortress to me all my days?'
10543 
10544 For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought
10545 just profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand
10546 are unmistakeable. But if, though unjust, I acquire the reputation of
10547 justice, a heavenly life is promised to me. Since then, as philosophers
10548 prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to
10549 appearance I must devote myself. I will describe around me a picture and
10550 shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house; behind I
10551 will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus, greatest of sages,
10552 recommends. But I hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of
10553 wickedness is often difficult; to which I answer, Nothing great is easy.
10554 Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we would be happy, to be
10555 the path along which we should proceed. With a view to concealment we
10556 will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs. And there
10557 are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and
10558 assemblies; and so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall
10559 make unlawful gains and not be punished. Still I hear a voice saying
10560 that the gods cannot be deceived, neither can they be compelled. But
10561 what if there are no gods? or, suppose them to have no care of human
10562 things--why in either case should we mind about concealment? And even if
10563 there are gods, and they do care about us, yet we know of them only
10564 from tradition and the genealogies of the poets; and these are the very
10565 persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by 'sacrifices
10566 and soothing entreaties and by offerings.' Let us be consistent then,
10567 and believe both or neither. If the poets speak truly, why then we had
10568 better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice; for if we are
10569 just, although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we shall lose the
10570 gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep the gains, and
10571 by our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning, the gods will be
10572 propitiated, and we shall not be punished. 'But there is a world below
10573 in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds.'
10574 Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there are mysteries and
10575 atoning deities, and these have great power. That is what mighty
10576 cities declare; and the children of the gods, who were their poets and
10577 prophets, bear a like testimony.
10578 
10579 On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than
10580 the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful
10581 regard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and
10582 men, in life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest
10583 authorities tell us. Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who
10584 has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to
10585 honour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice
10586 praised? And even if there should be some one who is able to disprove
10587 the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that justice is best, still
10588 he is not angry with the unjust, but is very ready to forgive them,
10589 because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will;
10590 unless, peradventure, there be some one whom the divinity within him may
10591 have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has attained knowledge
10592 of the truth--but no other man. He only blames injustice who, owing to
10593 cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the power of being unjust.
10594 And this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power, he
10595 immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be.
10596 
10597 The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning of
10598 the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were to
10599 find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice--beginning with
10600 the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and
10601 ending with the men of our own time--no one has ever blamed injustice or
10602 praised justice except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits
10603 which flow from them. No one has ever adequately described either in
10604 verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in
10605 the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of
10606 all the things of a man's soul which he has within him, justice is
10607 the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil. Had this been the
10608 universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth
10609 upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from
10610 doing wrong, but every one would have been his own watchman, because
10611 afraid, if he did wrong, of harbouring in himself the greatest of
10612 evils. I dare say that Thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the
10613 language which I have been merely repeating, and words even stronger
10614 than these about justice and injustice, grossly, as I conceive,
10615 perverting their true nature. But I speak in this vehement manner, as
10616 I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from you the
10617 opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority
10618 which justice has over injustice, but what effect they have on the
10619 possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil
10620 to him. And please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations;
10621 for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and
10622 add on the false, we shall say that you do not praise justice, but the
10623 appearance of it; we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep
10624 injustice dark, and that you really agree with Thrasymachus in thinking
10625 that justice is another's good and the interest of the stronger, and
10626 that injustice is a man's own profit and interest, though injurious to
10627 the weaker. Now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest
10628 class of goods which are desired indeed for their results, but in a far
10629 greater degree for their own sakes--like sight or hearing or knowledge
10630 or health, or any other real and natural and not merely conventional
10631 good--I would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point
10632 only: I mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice
10633 work in the possessors of them. Let others praise justice and censure
10634 injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the
10635 other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them, I am
10636 ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in the
10637 consideration of this question, unless I hear the contrary from your own
10638 lips, I expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only prove to
10639 us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they either of
10640 them do to the possessor of them, which makes the one to be a good and
10641 the other an evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and men.
10642 
10643 I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but on
10644 hearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an
10645 illustrious father, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses
10646 which the admirer of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had
10647 distinguished yourselves at the battle of Megara:--
10648 
10649 'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious hero.'
10650 
10651 The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine in
10652 being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice,
10653 and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. And I do believe that
10654 you are not convinced--this I infer from your general character, for had
10655 I judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But
10656 now, the greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in
10657 knowing what to say. For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand I
10658 feel that I am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to
10659 me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which I made
10660 to Thrasymachus, proving, as I thought, the superiority which justice
10661 has over injustice. And yet I cannot refuse to help, while breath and
10662 speech remain to me; I am afraid that there would be an impiety in being
10663 present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her
10664 defence. And therefore I had best give such help as I can.
10665 
10666 Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question
10667 drop, but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the
10668 truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,
10669 about their relative advantages. I told them, what I really thought,
10670 that the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very
10671 good eyes. Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that
10672 we had better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that
10673 a short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters
10674 from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be
10675 found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were
10676 larger--if they were the same and he could read the larger letters
10677 first, and then proceed to the lesser--this would have been thought a
10678 rare piece of good fortune.
10679 
10680 Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to our
10681 enquiry?
10682 
10683 I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our
10684 enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an
10685 individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State.
10686 
10687 True, he replied.
10688 
10689 And is not a State larger than an individual?
10690 
10691 It is.
10692 
10693 Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and
10694 more easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the
10695 nature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and
10696 secondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser
10697 and comparing them.
10698 
10699 That, he said, is an excellent proposal.
10700 
10701 And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the
10702 justice and injustice of the State in process of creation also.
10703 
10704 I dare say.
10705 
10706 When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of our
10707 search will be more easily discovered.
10708 
10709 Yes, far more easily.
10710 
10711 But ought we to attempt to construct one? I said; for to do so, as I am
10712 inclined to think, will be a very serious task. Reflect therefore.
10713 
10714 I have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should
10715 proceed.
10716 
10717 A State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind;
10718 no one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. Can any other
10719 origin of a State be imagined?
10720 
10721 There can be no other.
10722 
10723 Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply them,
10724 one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and when
10725 these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the
10726 body of inhabitants is termed a State.
10727 
10728 True, he said.
10729 
10730 And they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives,
10731 under the idea that the exchange will be for their good.
10732 
10733 Very true.
10734 
10735 Then, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the true
10736 creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.
10737 
10738 Of course, he replied.
10739 
10740 Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the
10741 condition of life and existence.
10742 
10743 Certainly.
10744 
10745 The second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.
10746 
10747 True.
10748 
10749 And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great
10750 demand: We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder,
10751 some one else a weaver--shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps
10752 some other purveyor to our bodily wants?
10753 
10754 Quite right.
10755 
10756 The barest notion of a State must include four or five men.
10757 
10758 Clearly.
10759 
10760 And how will they proceed? Will each bring the result of his labours
10761 into a common stock?--the individual husbandman, for example, producing
10762 for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the
10763 provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself;
10764 or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of
10765 producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food
10766 in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time
10767 be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no
10768 partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
10769 
10770 Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at
10771 producing everything.
10772 
10773 Probably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear you
10774 say this, I am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there
10775 are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different
10776 occupations.
10777 
10778 Very true.
10779 
10780 And will you have a work better done when the workman has many
10781 occupations, or when he has only one?
10782 
10783 When he has only one.
10784 
10785 Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at
10786 the right time?
10787 
10788 No doubt.
10789 
10790 For business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is
10791 at leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make the
10792 business his first object.
10793 
10794 He must.
10795 
10796 And if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully
10797 and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is
10798 natural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other things.
10799 
10800 Undoubtedly.
10801 
10802 Then more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will
10803 not make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture,
10804 if they are to be good for anything. Neither will the builder make
10805 his tools--and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and
10806 shoemaker.
10807 
10808 True.
10809 
10810 Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in
10811 our little State, which is already beginning to grow?
10812 
10813 True.
10814 
10815 Yet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order
10816 that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well
10817 as husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces
10818 and hides,--still our State will not be very large.
10819 
10820 That is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains
10821 all these.
10822 
10823 Then, again, there is the situation of the city--to find a place where
10824 nothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible.
10825 
10826 Impossible.
10827 
10828 Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required
10829 supply from another city?
10830 
10831 There must.
10832 
10833 But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require
10834 who would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.
10835 
10836 That is certain.
10837 
10838 And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for
10839 themselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate
10840 those from whom their wants are supplied.
10841 
10842 Very true.
10843 
10844 Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?
10845 
10846 They will.
10847 
10848 Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?
10849 
10850 Yes.
10851 
10852 Then we shall want merchants?
10853 
10854 We shall.
10855 
10856 And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will
10857 also be needed, and in considerable numbers?
10858 
10859 Yes, in considerable numbers.
10860 
10861 Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?
10862 To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our
10863 principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a
10864 State.
10865 
10866 Clearly they will buy and sell.
10867 
10868 Then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of
10869 exchange.
10870 
10871 Certainly.
10872 
10873 Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production
10874 to market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with
10875 him,--is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?
10876 
10877 Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake
10878 the office of salesmen. In well-ordered states they are commonly those
10879 who are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for
10880 any other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money
10881 in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from
10882 those who desire to buy.
10883 
10884 This want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State. Is
10885 not 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the
10886 market-place engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from
10887 one city to another are called merchants?
10888 
10889 Yes, he said.
10890 
10891 And there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly
10892 on the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength
10893 for labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I do not
10894 mistake, hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the price of
10895 their labour.
10896 
10897 True.
10898 
10899 Then hirelings will help to make up our population?
10900 
10901 Yes.
10902 
10903 And now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?
10904 
10905 I think so.
10906 
10907 Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of the
10908 State did they spring up?
10909 
10910 Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. I cannot
10911 imagine that they are more likely to be found any where else.
10912 
10913 I dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; we had better
10914 think the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry.
10915 
10916 Let us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life,
10917 now that we have thus established them. Will they not produce corn, and
10918 wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves? And
10919 when they are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and
10920 barefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod. They will feed
10921 on barley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making
10922 noble cakes and loaves; these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on
10923 clean leaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew
10924 or myrtle. And they and their children will feast, drinking of the wine
10925 which they have made, wearing garlands on their heads, and hymning the
10926 praises of the gods, in happy converse with one another. And they will
10927 take care that their families do not exceed their means; having an eye
10928 to poverty or war.
10929 
10930 But, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to
10931 their meal.
10932 
10933 True, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a
10934 relish--salt, and olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs
10935 such as country people prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs,
10936 and peas, and beans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns
10937 at the fire, drinking in moderation. And with such a diet they may be
10938 expected to live in peace and health to a good old age, and bequeath a
10939 similar life to their children after them.
10940 
10941 Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs,
10942 how else would you feed the beasts?
10943 
10944 But what would you have, Glaucon? I replied.
10945 
10946 Why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.
10947 People who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and
10948 dine off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern
10949 style.
10950 
10951 Yes, I said, now I understand: the question which you would have me
10952 consider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is created;
10953 and possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we shall be
10954 more likely to see how justice and injustice originate. In my opinion
10955 the true and healthy constitution of the State is the one which I have
10956 described. But if you wish also to see a State at fever-heat, I have
10957 no objection. For I suspect that many will not be satisfied with the
10958 simpler way of life. They will be for adding sofas, and tables,
10959 and other furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and
10960 courtesans, and cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every
10961 variety; we must go beyond the necessaries of which I was at first
10962 speaking, such as houses, and clothes, and shoes: the arts of the
10963 painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion, and gold and
10964 ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured.
10965 
10966 True, he said.
10967 
10968 Then we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State is
10969 no longer sufficient. Now will the city have to fill and swell with a
10970 multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want; such
10971 as the whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class
10972 have to do with forms and colours; another will be the votaries of
10973 music--poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists, players, dancers,
10974 contractors; also makers of divers kinds of articles, including women's
10975 dresses. And we shall want more servants. Will not tutors be also in
10976 request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as
10977 confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and
10978 therefore had no place in the former edition of our State, but are
10979 needed now? They must not be forgotten: and there will be animals of
10980 many other kinds, if people eat them.
10981 
10982 Certainly.
10983 
10984 And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians
10985 than before?
10986 
10987 Much greater.
10988 
10989 And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants
10990 will be too small now, and not enough?
10991 
10992 Quite true.
10993 
10994 Then a slice of our neighbours' land will be wanted by us for pasture
10995 and tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves,
10996 they exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the
10997 unlimited accumulation of wealth?
10998 
10999 That, Socrates, will be inevitable.
11000 
11001 And so we shall go to war, Glaucon. Shall we not?
11002 
11003 Most certainly, he replied.
11004 
11005 Then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus much
11006 we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes
11007 which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States, private as
11008 well as public.
11009 
11010 Undoubtedly.
11011 
11012 And our State must once more enlarge; and this time the enlargement will
11013 be nothing short of a whole army, which will have to go out and fight
11014 with the invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things and
11015 persons whom we were describing above.
11016 
11017 Why? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?
11018 
11019 No, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged
11020 by all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you will
11021 remember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with success.
11022 
11023 Very true, he said.
11024 
11025 But is not war an art?
11026 
11027 Certainly.
11028 
11029 And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?
11030 
11031 Quite true.
11032 
11033 And the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman, or a weaver,
11034 or a builder--in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to
11035 him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by
11036 nature fitted, and at that he was to continue working all his life long
11037 and at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then he would
11038 become a good workman. Now nothing can be more important than that
11039 the work of a soldier should be well done. But is war an art so easily
11040 acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman, or
11041 shoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the world would be a
11042 good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation,
11043 and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing
11044 else? No tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence,
11045 nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has
11046 never bestowed any attention upon them. How then will he who takes up
11047 a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day,
11048 whether with heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?
11049 
11050 Yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be
11051 beyond price.
11052 
11053 And the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more time, and
11054 skill, and art, and application will be needed by him?
11055 
11056 No doubt, he replied.
11057 
11058 Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?
11059 
11060 Certainly.
11061 
11062 Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted
11063 for the task of guarding the city?
11064 
11065 It will.
11066 
11067 And the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be brave
11068 and do our best.
11069 
11070 We must.
11071 
11072 Is not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding
11073 and watching?
11074 
11075 What do you mean?
11076 
11077 I mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake
11078 the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught
11079 him, they have to fight with him.
11080 
11081 All these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.
11082 
11083 Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?
11084 
11085 Certainly.
11086 
11087 And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog
11088 or any other animal? Have you never observed how invincible and
11089 unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any
11090 creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?
11091 
11092 I have.
11093 
11094 Then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are
11095 required in the guardian.
11096 
11097 True.
11098 
11099 And also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?
11100 
11101 Yes.
11102 
11103 But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another,
11104 and with everybody else?
11105 
11106 A difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied.
11107 
11108 Whereas, I said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and gentle
11109 to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without waiting
11110 for their enemies to destroy them.
11111 
11112 True, he said.
11113 
11114 What is to be done then? I said; how shall we find a gentle nature which
11115 has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the other?
11116 
11117 True.
11118 
11119 He will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two
11120 qualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible; and
11121 hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.
11122 
11123 I am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.
11124 
11125 Here feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded.--My
11126 friend, I said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost
11127 sight of the image which we had before us.
11128 
11129 What do you mean? he said.
11130 
11131 I mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite
11132 qualities.
11133 
11134 And where do you find them?
11135 
11136 Many animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog
11137 is a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle to
11138 their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.
11139 
11140 Yes, I know.
11141 
11142 Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our
11143 finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?
11144 
11145 Certainly not.
11146 
11147 Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited
11148 nature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher?
11149 
11150 I do not apprehend your meaning.
11151 
11152 The trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in the
11153 dog, and is remarkable in the animal.
11154 
11155 What trait?
11156 
11157 Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance,
11158 he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor the
11159 other any good. Did this never strike you as curious?
11160 
11161 The matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth of
11162 your remark.
11163 
11164 And surely this instinct of the dog is very charming;--your dog is a
11165 true philosopher.
11166 
11167 Why?
11168 
11169 Why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only
11170 by the criterion of knowing and not knowing. And must not an animal be a
11171 lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test
11172 of knowledge and ignorance?
11173 
11174 Most assuredly.
11175 
11176 And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?
11177 
11178 They are the same, he replied.
11179 
11180 And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be
11181 gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of
11182 wisdom and knowledge?
11183 
11184 That we may safely affirm.
11185 
11186 Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will
11187 require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and
11188 strength?
11189 
11190 Undoubtedly.
11191 
11192 Then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them,
11193 how are they to be reared and educated? Is not this an enquiry which
11194 may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final
11195 end--How do justice and injustice grow up in States? for we do not want
11196 either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an
11197 inconvenient length.
11198 
11199 Adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.
11200 
11201 Then, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if
11202 somewhat long.
11203 
11204 Certainly not.
11205 
11206 Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our
11207 story shall be the education of our heroes.
11208 
11209 By all means.
11210 
11211 And what shall be their education? Can we find a better than the
11212 traditional sort?--and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body,
11213 and music for the soul.
11214 
11215 True.
11216 
11217 Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?
11218 
11219 By all means.
11220 
11221 And when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?
11222 
11223 I do.
11224 
11225 And literature may be either true or false?
11226 
11227 Yes.
11228 
11229 And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the
11230 false?
11231 
11232 I do not understand your meaning, he said.
11233 
11234 You know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which,
11235 though not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious;
11236 and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn
11237 gymnastics.
11238 
11239 Very true.
11240 
11241 That was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before
11242 gymnastics.
11243 
11244 Quite right, he said.
11245 
11246 You know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work,
11247 especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time
11248 at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is
11249 more readily taken.
11250 
11251 Quite true.
11252 
11253 And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales
11254 which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds
11255 ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish
11256 them to have when they are grown up?
11257 
11258 We cannot.
11259 
11260 Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of
11261 fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good,
11262 and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their
11263 children the authorised ones only. Let them fashion the mind with such
11264 tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands; but
11265 most of those which are now in use must be discarded.
11266 
11267 Of what tales are you speaking? he said.
11268 
11269 You may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for they are
11270 necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of
11271 them.
11272 
11273 Very likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would term
11274 the greater.
11275 
11276 Those, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the rest of
11277 the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.
11278 
11279 But which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with
11280 them?
11281 
11282 A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, and,
11283 what is more, a bad lie.
11284 
11285 But when is this fault committed?
11286 
11287 Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and
11288 heroes,--as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a
11289 likeness to the original.
11290 
11291 Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blameable; but what
11292 are the stories which you mean?
11293 
11294 First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies in high
11295 places, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie
11296 too,--I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated
11297 on him. The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son
11298 inflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be
11299 lightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had
11300 better be buried in silence. But if there is an absolute necessity
11301 for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and
11302 they should sacrifice not a common (Eleusinian) pig, but some huge and
11303 unprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will be very few
11304 indeed.
11305 
11306 Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.
11307 
11308 Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; the
11309 young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he
11310 is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises his
11311 father when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following
11312 the example of the first and greatest among the gods.
11313 
11314 I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are
11315 quite unfit to be repeated.
11316 
11317 Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of
11318 quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should
11319 any word be said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and
11320 fightings of the gods against one another, for they are not true. No,
11321 we shall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be
11322 embroidered on garments; and we shall be silent about the innumerable
11323 other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives.
11324 If they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling
11325 is unholy, and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel
11326 between citizens; this is what old men and old women should begin by
11327 telling children; and when they grow up, the poets also should be told
11328 to compose for them in a similar spirit. But the narrative of Hephaestus
11329 binding Here his mother, or how on another occasion Zeus sent him flying
11330 for taking her part when she was being beaten, and all the battles of
11331 the gods in Homer--these tales must not be admitted into our State,
11332 whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. For
11333 a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal;
11334 anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become
11335 indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the
11336 tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts.
11337 
11338 There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such
11339 models to be found and of what tales are you speaking--how shall we
11340 answer him?
11341 
11342 I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets,
11343 but founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the
11344 general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits
11345 which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their
11346 business.
11347 
11348 Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you mean?
11349 
11350 Something of this kind, I replied:--God is always to be represented as
11351 he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in
11352 which the representation is given.
11353 
11354 Right.
11355 
11356 And is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as such?
11357 
11358 Certainly.
11359 
11360 And no good thing is hurtful?
11361 
11362 No, indeed.
11363 
11364 And that which is not hurtful hurts not?
11365 
11366 Certainly not.
11367 
11368 And that which hurts not does no evil?
11369 
11370 No.
11371 
11372 And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?
11373 
11374 Impossible.
11375 
11376 And the good is advantageous?
11377 
11378 Yes.
11379 
11380 And therefore the cause of well-being?
11381 
11382 Yes.
11383 
11384 It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, but
11385 of the good only?
11386 
11387 Assuredly.
11388 
11389 Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many
11390 assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things
11391 that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the
11392 evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the
11393 causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.
11394 
11395 That appears to me to be most true, he said.
11396 
11397 Then we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty of
11398 the folly of saying that two casks
11399 
11400 'Lie at the threshold of Zeus, full of lots, one of good, the other of
11401 evil lots,'
11402 
11403 and that he to whom Zeus gives a mixture of the two
11404 
11405 'Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;'
11406 
11407 but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill,
11408 
11409 'Him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth.'
11410 
11411 And again--
11412 
11413 'Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us.'
11414 
11415 And if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, which
11416 was really the work of Pandarus, was brought about by Athene and Zeus,
11417 or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by Themis
11418 and Zeus, he shall not have our approval; neither will we allow our
11419 young men to hear the words of Aeschylus, that
11420 
11421 'God plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house.'
11422 
11423 And if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe--the subject of the
11424 tragedy in which these iambic verses occur--or of the house of Pelops,
11425 or of the Trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must not permit
11426 him to say that these are the works of God, or if they are of God, he
11427 must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must say
11428 that God did what was just and right, and they were the better for being
11429 punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and that God
11430 is the author of their misery--the poet is not to be permitted to say;
11431 though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require
11432 to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from God;
11433 but that God being good is the author of evil to any one is to be
11434 strenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or
11435 prose by any one whether old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth.
11436 Such a fiction is suicidal, ruinous, impious.
11437 
11438 I agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the law.
11439 
11440 Let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods, to
11441 which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform,--that God is
11442 not the author of all things, but of good only.
11443 
11444 That will do, he said.
11445 
11446 And what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you whether God
11447 is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape,
11448 and now in another--sometimes himself changing and passing into
11449 many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such
11450 transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own
11451 proper image?
11452 
11453 I cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.
11454 
11455 Well, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must
11456 be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?
11457 
11458 Most certainly.
11459 
11460 And things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered
11461 or discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human
11462 frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant
11463 which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat
11464 of the sun or any similar causes.
11465 
11466 Of course.
11467 
11468 And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged
11469 by any external influence?
11470 
11471 True.
11472 
11473 And the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite
11474 things--furniture, houses, garments: when good and well made, they are
11475 least altered by time and circumstances.
11476 
11477 Very true.
11478 
11479 Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both,
11480 is least liable to suffer change from without?
11481 
11482 True.
11483 
11484 But surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect?
11485 
11486 Of course they are.
11487 
11488 Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many
11489 shapes?
11490 
11491 He cannot.
11492 
11493 But may he not change and transform himself?
11494 
11495 Clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.
11496 
11497 And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the
11498 worse and more unsightly?
11499 
11500 If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot
11501 suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.
11502 
11503 Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or man,
11504 desire to make himself worse?
11505 
11506 Impossible.
11507 
11508 Then it is impossible that God should ever be willing to change; being,
11509 as is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every God
11510 remains absolutely and for ever in his own form.
11511 
11512 That necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.
11513 
11514 Then, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that
11515 
11516 'The gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk up
11517 and down cities in all sorts of forms;'
11518 
11519 and let no one slander Proteus and Thetis, neither let any one, either
11520 in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry, introduce Here disguised in
11521 the likeness of a priestess asking an alms
11522 
11523 'For the life-giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos;'
11524 
11525 --let us have no more lies of that sort. Neither must we have mothers
11526 under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad
11527 version of these myths--telling how certain gods, as they say, 'Go about
11528 by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms;' but
11529 let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children, and at the
11530 same time speak blasphemy against the gods.
11531 
11532 Heaven forbid, he said.
11533 
11534 But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft
11535 and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?
11536 
11537 Perhaps, he replied.
11538 
11539 Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether in
11540 word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?
11541 
11542 I cannot say, he replied.
11543 
11544 Do you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may be
11545 allowed, is hated of gods and men?
11546 
11547 What do you mean? he said.
11548 
11549 I mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and
11550 highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; there,
11551 above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him.
11552 
11553 Still, he said, I do not comprehend you.
11554 
11555 The reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning to
11556 my words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived
11557 or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of
11558 themselves, which is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to
11559 hold the lie, is what mankind least like;--that, I say, is what they
11560 utterly detest.
11561 
11562 There is nothing more hateful to them.
11563 
11564 And, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him who
11565 is deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only a
11566 kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul,
11567 not pure unadulterated falsehood. Am I not right?
11568 
11569 Perfectly right.
11570 
11571 The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?
11572 
11573 Yes.
11574 
11575 Whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful; in
11576 dealing with enemies--that would be an instance; or again, when those
11577 whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to
11578 do some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or
11579 preventive; also in the tales of mythology, of which we were just now
11580 speaking--because we do not know the truth about ancient times, we make
11581 falsehood as much like truth as we can, and so turn it to account.
11582 
11583 Very true, he said.
11584 
11585 But can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he is
11586 ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?
11587 
11588 That would be ridiculous, he said.
11589 
11590 Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of God?
11591 
11592 I should say not.
11593 
11594 Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?
11595 
11596 That is inconceivable.
11597 
11598 But he may have friends who are senseless or mad?
11599 
11600 But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God.
11601 
11602 Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie?
11603 
11604 None whatever.
11605 
11606 Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?
11607 
11608 Yes.
11609 
11610 Then is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes
11611 not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision.
11612 
11613 Your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own.
11614 
11615 You agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form in
11616 which we should write and speak about divine things. The gods are not
11617 magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in
11618 any way.
11619 
11620 I grant that.
11621 
11622 Then, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the lying
11623 dream which Zeus sends to Agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses
11624 of Aeschylus in which Thetis says that Apollo at her nuptials
11625 
11626 'Was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long,
11627 and to know no sickness. And when he had spoken of my lot as in all
11628 things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my
11629 soul. And I thought that the word of Phoebus, being divine and full of
11630 prophecy, would not fail. And now he himself who uttered the strain,
11631 he who was present at the banquet, and who said this--he it is who has
11632 slain my son.'
11633 
11634 These are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our
11635 anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall
11636 we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young,
11637 meaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be
11638 true worshippers of the gods and like them.
11639 
11640 I entirely agree, he said, in these principles, and promise to make them
11641 my laws.
11642 
11643 
11644 
11645 
11646 BOOK III.
11647 
11648 Such then, I said, are our principles of theology--some tales are to be
11649 told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth
11650 upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and to
11651 value friendship with one another.
11652 
11653 Yes; and I think that our principles are right, he said.
11654 
11655 But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons
11656 besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of
11657 death? Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?
11658 
11659 Certainly not, he said.
11660 
11661 And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle
11662 rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real
11663 and terrible?
11664 
11665 Impossible.
11666 
11667 Then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales
11668 as well as over the others, and beg them not simply to revile but rather
11669 to commend the world below, intimating to them that their descriptions
11670 are untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors.
11671 
11672 That will be our duty, he said.
11673 
11674 Then, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages,
11675 beginning with the verses,
11676 
11677 'I would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than
11678 rule over all the dead who have come to nought.'
11679 
11680 We must also expunge the verse, which tells us how Pluto feared,
11681 
11682 'Lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should be seen
11683 both of mortals and immortals.'
11684 
11685 And again:--
11686 
11687 'O heavens! verily in the house of Hades there is soul and ghostly form
11688 but no mind at all!'
11689 
11690 Again of Tiresias:--
11691 
11692 '(To him even after death did Persephone grant mind,) that he alone
11693 should be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades.'
11694 
11695 Again:--
11696 
11697 'The soul flying from the limbs had gone to Hades, lamenting her fate,
11698 leaving manhood and youth.'
11699 
11700 Again:--
11701 
11702 'And the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the earth.'
11703 
11704 And,--
11705 
11706 'As bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of them has dropped
11707 out of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling and cling
11708 to one another, so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they
11709 moved.'
11710 
11711 And we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike
11712 out these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical, or
11713 unattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical
11714 charm of them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who
11715 are meant to be free, and who should fear slavery more than death.
11716 
11717 Undoubtedly.
11718 
11719 Also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names which
11720 describe the world below--Cocytus and Styx, ghosts under the earth, and
11721 sapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes a
11722 shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them. I do not
11723 say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind; but
11724 there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too
11725 excitable and effeminate by them.
11726 
11727 There is a real danger, he said.
11728 
11729 Then we must have no more of them.
11730 
11731 True.
11732 
11733 Another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us.
11734 
11735 Clearly.
11736 
11737 And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous
11738 men?
11739 
11740 They will go with the rest.
11741 
11742 But shall we be right in getting rid of them? Reflect: our principle is
11743 that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man
11744 who is his comrade.
11745 
11746 Yes; that is our principle.
11747 
11748 And therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he
11749 had suffered anything terrible?
11750 
11751 He will not.
11752 
11753 Such an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and his
11754 own happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.
11755 
11756 True, he said.
11757 
11758 And for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation of
11759 fortune, is to him of all men least terrible.
11760 
11761 Assuredly.
11762 
11763 And therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with the
11764 greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him.
11765 
11766 Yes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.
11767 
11768 Then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men,
11769 and making them over to women (and not even to women who are good for
11770 anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are being educated
11771 by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like.
11772 
11773 That will be very right.
11774 
11775 Then we will once more entreat Homer and the other poets not to depict
11776 Achilles, who is the son of a goddess, first lying on his side, then on
11777 his back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in a frenzy
11778 along the shores of the barren sea; now taking the sooty ashes in both
11779 his hands and pouring them over his head, or weeping and wailing in the
11780 various modes which Homer has delineated. Nor should he describe Priam
11781 the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching,
11782 
11783 'Rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name.'
11784 
11785 Still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce
11786 the gods lamenting and saying,
11787 
11788 'Alas! my misery! Alas! that I bore the bravest to my sorrow.'
11789 
11790 But if he must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so
11791 completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods, as to make him
11792 say--
11793 
11794 'O heavens! with my eyes verily I behold a dear friend of mine chased
11795 round and round the city, and my heart is sorrowful.'
11796 
11797 Or again:--
11798 
11799 Woe is me that I am fated to have Sarpedon, dearest of men to me,
11800 subdued at the hands of Patroclus the son of Menoetius.'
11801 
11802 For if, my sweet Adeimantus, our youth seriously listen to such unworthy
11803 representations of the gods, instead of laughing at them as they ought,
11804 hardly will any of them deem that he himself, being but a man, can be
11805 dishonoured by similar actions; neither will he rebuke any inclination
11806 which may arise in his mind to say and do the like. And instead
11807 of having any shame or self-control, he will be always whining and
11808 lamenting on slight occasions.
11809 
11810 Yes, he said, that is most true.
11811 
11812 Yes, I replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the argument
11813 has just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until it is
11814 disproved by a better.
11815 
11816 It ought not to be.
11817 
11818 Neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. For a fit of
11819 laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a
11820 violent reaction.
11821 
11822 So I believe.
11823 
11824 Then persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be represented
11825 as overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation of
11826 the gods be allowed.
11827 
11828 Still less of the gods, as you say, he replied.
11829 
11830 Then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as
11831 that of Homer when he describes how
11832 
11833 'Inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when they saw
11834 Hephaestus bustling about the mansion.'
11835 
11836 On your views, we must not admit them.
11837 
11838 On my views, if you like to father them on me; that we must not admit
11839 them is certain.
11840 
11841 Again, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie is
11842 useless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then the
11843 use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private
11844 individuals have no business with them.
11845 
11846 Clearly not, he said.
11847 
11848 Then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of
11849 the State should be the persons; and they, in their dealings either with
11850 enemies or with their own citizens, may be allowed to lie for the public
11851 good. But nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind; and
11852 although the rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie to
11853 them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient
11854 or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily
11855 illnesses to the physician or to the trainer, or for a sailor not to
11856 tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the
11857 crew, and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors.
11858 
11859 Most true, he said.
11860 
11861 If, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the State,
11862 
11863 'Any of the craftsmen, whether he be priest or physician or carpenter,'
11864 
11865 he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally
11866 subversive and destructive of ship or State.
11867 
11868 Most certainly, he said, if our idea of the State is ever carried out.
11869 
11870 In the next place our youth must be temperate?
11871 
11872 Certainly.
11873 
11874 Are not the chief elements of temperance, speaking generally, obedience
11875 to commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures?
11876 
11877 True.
11878 
11879 Then we shall approve such language as that of Diomede in Homer,
11880 
11881 'Friend, sit still and obey my word,'
11882 
11883 and the verses which follow,
11884 
11885 'The Greeks marched breathing prowess, ...in silent awe of their
11886 leaders,'
11887 
11888 and other sentiments of the same kind.
11889 
11890 We shall.
11891 
11892 What of this line,
11893 
11894 'O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag,'
11895 
11896 and of the words which follow? Would you say that these, or any similar
11897 impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their
11898 rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?
11899 
11900 They are ill spoken.
11901 
11902 They may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce
11903 to temperance. And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young
11904 men--you would agree with me there?
11905 
11906 Yes.
11907 
11908 And then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his
11909 opinion is more glorious than
11910 
11911 'When the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries
11912 round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups,'
11913 
11914 is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words?
11915 Or the verse
11916 
11917 'The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?'
11918 
11919 What would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and
11920 men were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but
11921 forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely
11922 overcome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut,
11923 but wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never
11924 been in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one
11925 another
11926 
11927 'Without the knowledge of their parents;'
11928 
11929 or that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast
11930 a chain around Ares and Aphrodite?
11931 
11932 Indeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear
11933 that sort of thing.
11934 
11935 But any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, these
11936 they ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the verses,
11937 
11938 'He smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart, Endure, my heart;
11939 far worse hast thou endured!'
11940 
11941 Certainly, he said.
11942 
11943 In the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers
11944 of money.
11945 
11946 Certainly not.
11947 
11948 Neither must we sing to them of
11949 
11950 'Gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings.'
11951 
11952 Neither is Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles, to be approved or deemed to
11953 have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take
11954 the gifts of the Greeks and assist them; but that without a gift he
11955 should not lay aside his anger. Neither will we believe or acknowledge
11956 Achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took
11957 Agamemnon's gifts, or that when he had received payment he restored the
11958 dead body of Hector, but that without payment he was unwilling to do so.
11959 
11960 Undoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be approved.
11961 
11962 Loving Homer as I do, I hardly like to say that in attributing these
11963 feelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly attributed
11964 to him, he is guilty of downright impiety. As little can I believe the
11965 narrative of his insolence to Apollo, where he says,
11966 
11967 'Thou hast wronged me, O far-darter, most abominable of deities. Verily
11968 I would be even with thee, if I had only the power;'
11969 
11970 or his insubordination to the river-god, on whose divinity he is ready
11971 to lay hands; or his offering to the dead Patroclus of his own hair,
11972 which had been previously dedicated to the other river-god Spercheius,
11973 and that he actually performed this vow; or that he dragged Hector round
11974 the tomb of Patroclus, and slaughtered the captives at the pyre; of all
11975 this I cannot believe that he was guilty, any more than I can allow
11976 our citizens to believe that he, the wise Cheiron's pupil, the son of a
11977 goddess and of Peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent
11978 from Zeus, was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave
11979 of two seemingly inconsistent passions, meanness, not untainted by
11980 avarice, combined with overweening contempt of gods and men.
11981 
11982 You are quite right, he replied.
11983 
11984 And let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the tale
11985 of Theseus son of Poseidon, or of Peirithous son of Zeus, going forth as
11986 they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero or son of
11987 a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely
11988 ascribe to them in our day: and let us further compel the poets to
11989 declare either that these acts were not done by them, or that they
11990 were not the sons of gods;--both in the same breath they shall not be
11991 permitted to affirm. We will not have them trying to persuade our youth
11992 that the gods are the authors of evil, and that heroes are no better
11993 than men--sentiments which, as we were saying, are neither pious nor
11994 true, for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods.
11995 
11996 Assuredly not.
11997 
11998 And further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them;
11999 for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced
12000 that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by--
12001 
12002 'The kindred of the gods, the relatives of Zeus, whose ancestral altar,
12003 the altar of Zeus, is aloft in air on the peak of Ida,'
12004 
12005 and who have
12006 
12007 'the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins.'
12008 
12009 And therefore let us put an end to such tales, lest they engender laxity
12010 of morals among the young.
12011 
12012 By all means, he replied.
12013 
12014 But now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not
12015 to be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us. The
12016 manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should
12017 be treated has been already laid down.
12018 
12019 Very true.
12020 
12021 And what shall we say about men? That is clearly the remaining portion
12022 of our subject.
12023 
12024 Clearly so.
12025 
12026 But we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, my
12027 friend.
12028 
12029 Why not?
12030 
12031 Because, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men poets
12032 and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when
12033 they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good miserable;
12034 and that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that justice is a
12035 man's own loss and another's gain--these things we shall forbid them to
12036 utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.
12037 
12038 To be sure we shall, he replied.
12039 
12040 But if you admit that I am right in this, then I shall maintain that you
12041 have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending.
12042 
12043 I grant the truth of your inference.
12044 
12045 That such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which
12046 we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and how
12047 naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seem to be just or
12048 not.
12049 
12050 Most true, he said.
12051 
12052 Enough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and
12053 when this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been
12054 completely treated.
12055 
12056 I do not understand what you mean, said Adeimantus.
12057 
12058 Then I must make you understand; and perhaps I may be more intelligible
12059 if I put the matter in this way. You are aware, I suppose, that all
12060 mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or
12061 to come?
12062 
12063 Certainly, he replied.
12064 
12065 And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union
12066 of the two?
12067 
12068 That again, he said, I do not quite understand.
12069 
12070 I fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much
12071 difficulty in making myself apprehended. Like a bad speaker, therefore,
12072 I will not take the whole of the subject, but will break a piece off in
12073 illustration of my meaning. You know the first lines of the Iliad,
12074 in which the poet says that Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his
12075 daughter, and that Agamemnon flew into a passion with him; whereupon
12076 Chryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of the God against the
12077 Achaeans. Now as far as these lines,
12078 
12079 'And he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus,
12080 the chiefs of the people,'
12081 
12082 the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose
12083 that he is any one else. But in what follows he takes the person of
12084 Chryses, and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the
12085 speaker is not Homer, but the aged priest himself. And in this double
12086 form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at
12087 Troy and in Ithaca and throughout the Odyssey.
12088 
12089 Yes.
12090 
12091 And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites
12092 from time to time and in the intermediate passages?
12093 
12094 Quite true.
12095 
12096 But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that
12097 he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you,
12098 is going to speak?
12099 
12100 Certainly.
12101 
12102 And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice
12103 or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?
12104 
12105 Of course.
12106 
12107 Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by
12108 way of imitation?
12109 
12110 Very true.
12111 
12112 Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then
12113 again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration.
12114 However, in order that I may make my meaning quite clear, and that you
12115 may no more say, 'I don't understand,' I will show how the change might
12116 be effected. If Homer had said, 'The priest came, having his daughter's
12117 ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and above all the
12118 kings;' and then if, instead of speaking in the person of Chryses,
12119 he had continued in his own person, the words would have been, not
12120 imitation, but simple narration. The passage would have run as follows
12121 (I am no poet, and therefore I drop the metre), 'The priest came and
12122 prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks that they might capture Troy
12123 and return safely home, but begged that they would give him back his
12124 daughter, and take the ransom which he brought, and respect the God.
12125 Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered the priest and assented. But
12126 Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart and not come again, lest the
12127 staff and chaplets of the God should be of no avail to him--the daughter
12128 of Chryses should not be released, he said--she should grow old with him
12129 in Argos. And then he told him to go away and not to provoke him, if he
12130 intended to get home unscathed. And the old man went away in fear and
12131 silence, and, when he had left the camp, he called upon Apollo by his
12132 many names, reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to
12133 him, whether in building his temples, or in offering sacrifice, and
12134 praying that his good deeds might be returned to him, and that the
12135 Achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god,'--and so on.
12136 In this way the whole becomes simple narrative.
12137 
12138 I understand, he said.
12139 
12140 Or you may suppose the opposite case--that the intermediate passages are
12141 omitted, and the dialogue only left.
12142 
12143 That also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.
12144 
12145 You have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, what you
12146 failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry and
12147 mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative--instances of this are
12148 supplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style,
12149 in which the poet is the only speaker--of this the dithyramb affords
12150 the best example; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in
12151 several other styles of poetry. Do I take you with me?
12152 
12153 Yes, he said; I see now what you meant.
12154 
12155 I will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we had done
12156 with the subject and might proceed to the style.
12157 
12158 Yes, I remember.
12159 
12160 In saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an
12161 understanding about the mimetic art,--whether the poets, in narrating
12162 their stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether
12163 in whole or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all
12164 imitation be prohibited?
12165 
12166 You mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted
12167 into our State?
12168 
12169 Yes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really do
12170 not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.
12171 
12172 And go we will, he said.
12173 
12174 Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be
12175 imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule
12176 already laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many;
12177 and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fail of gaining much
12178 reputation in any?
12179 
12180 Certainly.
12181 
12182 And this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many
12183 things as well as he would imitate a single one?
12184 
12185 He cannot.
12186 
12187 Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life,
12188 and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as
12189 well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the same
12190 persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy
12191 and comedy--did you not just now call them imitations?
12192 
12193 Yes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot
12194 succeed in both.
12195 
12196 Any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?
12197 
12198 True.
12199 
12200 Neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things are
12201 but imitations.
12202 
12203 They are so.
12204 
12205 And human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet
12206 smaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well, as
12207 of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.
12208 
12209 Quite true, he replied.
12210 
12211 If then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that
12212 our guardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate
12213 themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making
12214 this their craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this
12215 end, they ought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they
12216 imitate at all, they should imitate from youth upward only those
12217 characters which are suitable to their profession--the courageous,
12218 temperate, holy, free, and the like; but they should not depict or be
12219 skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness, lest from
12220 imitation they should come to be what they imitate. Did you never
12221 observe how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far into
12222 life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature, affecting
12223 body, voice, and mind?
12224 
12225 Yes, certainly, he said.
12226 
12227 Then, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of
12228 whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether
12229 young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting
12230 against the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in
12231 affliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in
12232 sickness, love, or labour.
12233 
12234 Very right, he said.
12235 
12236 Neither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the
12237 offices of slaves?
12238 
12239 They must not.
12240 
12241 And surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the
12242 reverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or
12243 revile one another in drink or out of drink, or who in any other manner
12244 sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the
12245 manner of such is. Neither should they be trained to imitate the action
12246 or speech of men or women who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice, is
12247 to be known but not to be practised or imitated.
12248 
12249 Very true, he replied.
12250 
12251 Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or
12252 boatswains, or the like?
12253 
12254 How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to
12255 the callings of any of these?
12256 
12257 Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls, the
12258 murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort of
12259 thing?
12260 
12261 Nay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the
12262 behaviour of madmen.
12263 
12264 You mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one sort of
12265 narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has
12266 anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of an
12267 opposite character and education.
12268 
12269 And which are these two sorts? he asked.
12270 
12271 Suppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a
12272 narration comes on some saying or action of another good man,--I should
12273 imagine that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of
12274 this sort of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the
12275 good man when he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when
12276 he is overtaken by illness or love or drink, or has met with any other
12277 disaster. But when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him, he
12278 will not make a study of that; he will disdain such a person, and will
12279 assume his likeness, if at all, for a moment only when he is performing
12280 some good action; at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which
12281 he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion and frame himself
12282 after the baser models; he feels the employment of such an art, unless
12283 in jest, to be beneath him, and his mind revolts at it.
12284 
12285 So I should expect, he replied.
12286 
12287 Then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated
12288 out of Homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and
12289 narrative; but there will be very little of the former, and a great deal
12290 of the latter. Do you agree?
12291 
12292 Certainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must
12293 necessarily take.
12294 
12295 But there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, and,
12296 the worse he is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be too
12297 bad for him: and he will be ready to imitate anything, not as a joke,
12298 but in right good earnest, and before a large company. As I was just now
12299 saying, he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise of
12300 wind and hail, or the creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the various
12301 sounds of flutes, pipes, trumpets, and all sorts of instruments: he will
12302 bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep, or crow like a cock; his entire art
12303 will consist in imitation of voice and gesture, and there will be very
12304 little narration.
12305 
12306 That, he said, will be his mode of speaking.
12307 
12308 These, then, are the two kinds of style?
12309 
12310 Yes.
12311 
12312 And you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has
12313 but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen
12314 for their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if he speaks
12315 correctly, is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep
12316 within the limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great),
12317 and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?
12318 
12319 That is quite true, he said.
12320 
12321 Whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of
12322 rhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the style
12323 has all sorts of changes.
12324 
12325 That is also perfectly true, he replied.
12326 
12327 And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all
12328 poetry, and every form of expression in words? No one can say anything
12329 except in one or other of them or in both together.
12330 
12331 They include all, he said.
12332 
12333 And shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one only of
12334 the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?
12335 
12336 I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.
12337 
12338 Yes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and
12339 indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you,
12340 is the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with
12341 the world in general.
12342 
12343 I do not deny it.
12344 
12345 But I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our
12346 State, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man
12347 plays one part only?
12348 
12349 Yes; quite unsuitable.
12350 
12351 And this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we
12352 shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a
12353 husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a
12354 soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?
12355 
12356 True, he said.
12357 
12358 And therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so
12359 clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal
12360 to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as
12361 a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also inform him that
12362 in our State such as he are not permitted to exist; the law will not
12363 allow them. And so when we have anointed him with myrrh, and set a
12364 garland of wool upon his head, we shall send him away to another city.
12365 For we mean to employ for our souls' health the rougher and severer poet
12366 or story-teller, who will imitate the style of the virtuous only, and
12367 will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the
12368 education of our soldiers.
12369 
12370 We certainly will, he said, if we have the power.
12371 
12372 Then now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education
12373 which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished; for
12374 the matter and manner have both been discussed.
12375 
12376 I think so too, he said.
12377 
12378 Next in order will follow melody and song.
12379 
12380 That is obvious.
12381 
12382 Every one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are to
12383 be consistent with ourselves.
12384 
12385 I fear, said Glaucon, laughing, that the word 'every one' hardly
12386 includes me, for I cannot at the moment say what they should be; though
12387 I may guess.
12388 
12389 At any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts--the words,
12390 the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may presuppose?
12391 
12392 Yes, he said; so much as that you may.
12393 
12394 And as for the words, there will surely be no difference between words
12395 which are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same
12396 laws, and these have been already determined by us?
12397 
12398 Yes.
12399 
12400 And the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?
12401 
12402 Certainly.
12403 
12404 We were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no need
12405 of lamentation and strains of sorrow?
12406 
12407 True.
12408 
12409 And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? You are musical, and
12410 can tell me.
12411 
12412 The harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and the
12413 full-toned or bass Lydian, and such like.
12414 
12415 These then, I said, must be banished; even to women who have a character
12416 to maintain they are of no use, and much less to men.
12417 
12418 Certainly.
12419 
12420 In the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly
12421 unbecoming the character of our guardians.
12422 
12423 Utterly unbecoming.
12424 
12425 And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?
12426 
12427 The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed 'relaxed.'
12428 
12429 Well, and are these of any military use?
12430 
12431 Quite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian are
12432 the only ones which you have left.
12433 
12434 I answered: Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have one
12435 warlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the
12436 hour of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and he
12437 is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil, and
12438 at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a
12439 determination to endure; and another to be used by him in times of peace
12440 and freedom of action, when there is no pressure of necessity, and he is
12441 seeking to persuade God by prayer, or man by instruction and admonition,
12442 or on the other hand, when he is expressing his willingness to yield to
12443 persuasion or entreaty or admonition, and which represents him when
12444 by prudent conduct he has attained his end, not carried away by his
12445 success, but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances, and
12446 acquiescing in the event. These two harmonies I ask you to leave;
12447 the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the strain of the
12448 unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate, the strain of courage, and
12449 the strain of temperance; these, I say, leave.
12450 
12451 And these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of which I
12452 was just now speaking.
12453 
12454 Then, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs and
12455 melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic
12456 scale?
12457 
12458 I suppose not.
12459 
12460 Then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three
12461 corners and complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed
12462 curiously-harmonised instruments?
12463 
12464 Certainly not.
12465 
12466 But what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? Would you admit
12467 them into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of
12468 harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put
12469 together; even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?
12470 
12471 Clearly not.
12472 
12473 There remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city, and
12474 the shepherds may have a pipe in the country.
12475 
12476 That is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.
12477 
12478 The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his
12479 instruments is not at all strange, I said.
12480 
12481 Not at all, he replied.
12482 
12483 And so, by the dog of Egypt, we have been unconsciously purging the
12484 State, which not long ago we termed luxurious.
12485 
12486 And we have done wisely, he replied.
12487 
12488 Then let us now finish the purgation, I said. Next in order to
12489 harmonies, rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to
12490 the same rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre,
12491 or metres of every kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the
12492 expressions of a courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found
12493 them, we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like
12494 spirit, not the words to the foot and melody. To say what these rhythms
12495 are will be your duty--you must teach me them, as you have already
12496 taught me the harmonies.
12497 
12498 But, indeed, he replied, I cannot tell you. I only know that there
12499 are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are
12500 framed, just as in sounds there are four notes (i.e. the four notes of
12501 the tetrachord.) out of which all the harmonies are composed; that is
12502 an observation which I have made. But of what sort of lives they are
12503 severally the imitations I am unable to say.
12504 
12505 Then, I said, we must take Damon into our counsels; and he will tell us
12506 what rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury, or other
12507 unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite
12508 feelings. And I think that I have an indistinct recollection of his
12509 mentioning a complex Cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic, and he
12510 arranged them in some manner which I do not quite understand, making
12511 the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot, long and short
12512 alternating; and, unless I am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic as well
12513 as of a trochaic rhythm, and assigned to them short and long quantities.
12514 Also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the
12515 foot quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a combination of the two;
12516 for I am not certain what he meant. These matters, however, as I was
12517 saying, had better be referred to Damon himself, for the analysis of
12518 the subject would be difficult, you know? (Socrates expresses himself
12519 carelessly in accordance with his assumed ignorance of the details of
12520 the subject. In the first part of the sentence he appears to be speaking
12521 of paeonic rhythms which are in the ratio of 3/2; in the second part, of
12522 dactylic and anapaestic rhythms, which are in the ratio of 1/1; in the
12523 last clause, of iambic and trochaic rhythms, which are in the ratio of
12524 1/2 or 2/1.)
12525 
12526 Rather so, I should say.
12527 
12528 But there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace
12529 is an effect of good or bad rhythm.
12530 
12531 None at all.
12532 
12533 And also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad
12534 style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style; for our
12535 principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words, and not
12536 the words by them.
12537 
12538 Just so, he said, they should follow the words.
12539 
12540 And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the
12541 temper of the soul?
12542 
12543 Yes.
12544 
12545 And everything else on the style?
12546 
12547 Yes.
12548 
12549 Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on
12550 simplicity,--I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered
12551 mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism
12552 for folly?
12553 
12554 Very true, he replied.
12555 
12556 And if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these
12557 graces and harmonies their perpetual aim?
12558 
12559 They must.
12560 
12561 And surely the art of the painter and every other creative and
12562 constructive art are full of them,--weaving, embroidery, architecture,
12563 and every kind of manufacture; also nature, animal and vegetable,--in
12564 all of them there is grace or the absence of grace. And ugliness and
12565 discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill
12566 nature, as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue
12567 and bear their likeness.
12568 
12569 That is quite true, he said.
12570 
12571 But shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only to
12572 be required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on
12573 pain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State? Or is the
12574 same control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be
12575 prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance
12576 and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other
12577 creative arts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be
12578 prevented from practising his art in our State, lest the taste of our
12579 citizens be corrupted by him? We would not have our guardians grow up
12580 amid images of moral deformity, as in some noxious pasture, and there
12581 browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little
12582 by little, until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption
12583 in their own soul. Let our artists rather be those who are gifted to
12584 discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful; then will our
12585 youth dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights and sounds, and
12586 receive the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence of fair works,
12587 shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze from a
12588 purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into
12589 likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.
12590 
12591 There can be no nobler training than that, he replied.
12592 
12593 And therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent
12594 instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way
12595 into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten,
12596 imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated
12597 graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because
12598 he who has received this true education of the inner being will most
12599 shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and with a true
12600 taste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the
12601 good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame and hate the bad,
12602 now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reason
12603 why; and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with
12604 whom his education has made him long familiar.
12605 
12606 Yes, he said, I quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should
12607 be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention.
12608 
12609 Just as in learning to read, I said, we were satisfied when we knew
12610 the letters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring
12611 sizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether they
12612 occupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them out;
12613 and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we
12614 recognise them wherever they are found:
12615 
12616 True--
12617 
12618 Or, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in a
12619 mirror, only when we know the letters themselves; the same art and study
12620 giving us the knowledge of both:
12621 
12622 Exactly--
12623 
12624 Even so, as I maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom we have to
12625 educate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential
12626 forms of temperance, courage, liberality, magnificence, and their
12627 kindred, as well as the contrary forms, in all their combinations,
12628 and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found, not
12629 slighting them either in small things or great, but believing them all
12630 to be within the sphere of one art and study.
12631 
12632 Most assuredly.
12633 
12634 And when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the two
12635 are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has
12636 an eye to see it?
12637 
12638 The fairest indeed.
12639 
12640 And the fairest is also the loveliest?
12641 
12642 That may be assumed.
12643 
12644 And the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the
12645 loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?
12646 
12647 That is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if there
12648 be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it, and
12649 will love all the same.
12650 
12651 I perceive, I said, that you have or have had experiences of this sort,
12652 and I agree. But let me ask you another question: Has excess of pleasure
12653 any affinity to temperance?
12654 
12655 How can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of his
12656 faculties quite as much as pain.
12657 
12658 Or any affinity to virtue in general?
12659 
12660 None whatever.
12661 
12662 Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance?
12663 
12664 Yes, the greatest.
12665 
12666 And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?
12667 
12668 No, nor a madder.
12669 
12670 Whereas true love is a love of beauty and order--temperate and
12671 harmonious?
12672 
12673 Quite true, he said.
12674 
12675 Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?
12676 
12677 Certainly not.
12678 
12679 Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the
12680 lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their
12681 love is of the right sort?
12682 
12683 No, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near them.
12684 
12685 Then I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a
12686 law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to
12687 his love than a father would use to his son, and then only for a noble
12688 purpose, and he must first have the other's consent; and this rule is
12689 to limit him in all his intercourse, and he is never to be seen going
12690 further, or, if he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and
12691 bad taste.
12692 
12693 I quite agree, he said.
12694 
12695 Thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the
12696 end of music if not the love of beauty?
12697 
12698 I agree, he said.
12699 
12700 After music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.
12701 
12702 Certainly.
12703 
12704 Gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training
12705 in it should be careful and should continue through life. Now my belief
12706 is,--and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion
12707 in confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,--not that the good body
12708 by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that
12709 the good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this
12710 may be possible. What do you say?
12711 
12712 Yes, I agree.
12713 
12714 Then, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing
12715 over the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid
12716 prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.
12717 
12718 Very good.
12719 
12720 That they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by
12721 us; for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and
12722 not know where in the world he is.
12723 
12724 Yes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take
12725 care of him is ridiculous indeed.
12726 
12727 But next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training
12728 for the great contest of all--are they not?
12729 
12730 Yes, he said.
12731 
12732 And will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?
12733 
12734 Why not?
12735 
12736 I am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but a
12737 sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. Do you not observe
12738 that these athletes sleep away their lives, and are liable to most
12739 dangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree, from
12740 their customary regimen?
12741 
12742 Yes, I do.
12743 
12744 Then, I said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior
12745 athletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the
12746 utmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food, of
12747 summer heat and winter cold, which they will have to endure when on a
12748 campaign, they must not be liable to break down in health.
12749 
12750 That is my view.
12751 
12752 The really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which
12753 we were just now describing.
12754 
12755 How so?
12756 
12757 Why, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is
12758 simple and good; and especially the military gymnastic.
12759 
12760 What do you mean?
12761 
12762 My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at
12763 their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they have
12764 no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they
12765 are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most
12766 convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire,
12767 and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.
12768 
12769 True.
12770 
12771 And I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere
12772 mentioned in Homer. In proscribing them, however, he is not singular;
12773 all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good
12774 condition should take nothing of the kind.
12775 
12776 Yes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking them.
12777 
12778 Then you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the refinements of
12779 Sicilian cookery?
12780 
12781 I think not.
12782 
12783 Nor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a
12784 Corinthian girl as his fair friend?
12785 
12786 Certainly not.
12787 
12788 Neither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of
12789 Athenian confectionary?
12790 
12791 Certainly not.
12792 
12793 All such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and
12794 song composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms.
12795 
12796 Exactly.
12797 
12798 There complexity engendered licence, and here disease; whereas
12799 simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and
12800 simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body.
12801 
12802 Most true, he said.
12803 
12804 But when intemperance and diseases multiply in a State, halls of justice
12805 and medicine are always being opened; and the arts of the doctor and the
12806 lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the interest which not
12807 only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them.
12808 
12809 Of course.
12810 
12811 And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state
12812 of education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of
12813 people need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also
12814 those who would profess to have had a liberal education? Is it not
12815 disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man
12816 should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of
12817 his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of
12818 other men whom he makes lords and judges over him?
12819 
12820 Of all things, he said, the most disgraceful.
12821 
12822 Would you say 'most,' I replied, when you consider that there is
12823 a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long
12824 litigant, passing all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or
12825 defendant, but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his
12826 litigiousness; he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty; able to
12827 take every crooked turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole,
12828 bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice: and all
12829 for what?--in order to gain small points not worth mentioning, he not
12830 knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping
12831 judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing. Is not that still more
12832 disgraceful?
12833 
12834 Yes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.
12835 
12836 Well, I said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a wound
12837 has to be cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but just because, by
12838 indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing, men
12839 fill themselves with waters and winds, as if their bodies were a marsh,
12840 compelling the ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names for
12841 diseases, such as flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a disgrace?
12842 
12843 Yes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names
12844 to diseases.
12845 
12846 Yes, I said, and I do not believe that there were any such diseases in
12847 the days of Asclepius; and this I infer from the circumstance that the
12848 hero Eurypylus, after he has been wounded in Homer, drinks a posset of
12849 Pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese, which
12850 are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of Asclepius who were
12851 at the Trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink, or
12852 rebuke Patroclus, who is treating his case.
12853 
12854 Well, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a
12855 person in his condition.
12856 
12857 Not so extraordinary, I replied, if you bear in mind that in former
12858 days, as is commonly said, before the time of Herodicus, the guild of
12859 Asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine, which may be
12860 said to educate diseases. But Herodicus, being a trainer, and himself of
12861 a sickly constitution, by a combination of training and doctoring found
12862 out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself, and secondly the rest
12863 of the world.
12864 
12865 How was that? he said.
12866 
12867 By the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which
12868 he perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he
12869 passed his entire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but
12870 attend upon himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he departed
12871 in anything from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the help of
12872 science he struggled on to old age.
12873 
12874 A rare reward of his skill!
12875 
12876 Yes, I said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never
12877 understood that, if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants
12878 in valetudinarian arts, the omission arose, not from ignorance or
12879 inexperience of such a branch of medicine, but because he knew that in
12880 all well-ordered states every individual has an occupation to which he
12881 must attend, and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being
12882 ill. This we remark in the case of the artisan, but, ludicrously enough,
12883 do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort.
12884 
12885 How do you mean? he said.
12886 
12887 I mean this: When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough
12888 and ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife,--these
12889 are his remedies. And if some one prescribes for him a course of
12890 dietetics, and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and
12891 all that sort of thing, he replies at once that he has no time to be
12892 ill, and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing
12893 his disease to the neglect of his customary employment; and therefore
12894 bidding good-bye to this sort of physician, he resumes his ordinary
12895 habits, and either gets well and lives and does his business, or, if his
12896 constitution fails, he dies and has no more trouble.
12897 
12898 Yes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of
12899 medicine thus far only.
12900 
12901 Has he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there be in his
12902 life if he were deprived of his occupation?
12903 
12904 Quite true, he said.
12905 
12906 But with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that he
12907 has any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would
12908 live.
12909 
12910 He is generally supposed to have nothing to do.
12911 
12912 Then you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as a man
12913 has a livelihood he should practise virtue?
12914 
12915 Nay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.
12916 
12917 Let us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather ask
12918 ourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or
12919 can he live without it? And if obligatory on him, then let us raise
12920 a further question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an
12921 impediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the
12922 mechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of
12923 Phocylides?
12924 
12925 Of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the
12926 body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to
12927 the practice of virtue.
12928 
12929 Yes, indeed, I replied, and equally incompatible with the management of
12930 a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important
12931 of all, irreconcileable with any kind of study or thought or
12932 self-reflection--there is a constant suspicion that headache and
12933 giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or
12934 making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for
12935 a man is always fancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant
12936 anxiety about the state of his body.
12937 
12938 Yes, likely enough.
12939 
12940 And therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited
12941 the power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy
12942 constitution and habits of life, had a definite ailment; such as these
12943 he cured by purges and operations, and bade them live as usual, herein
12944 consulting the interests of the State; but bodies which disease had
12945 penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure
12946 by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion: he did not want to
12947 lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak fathers begetting
12948 weaker sons;--if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he
12949 had no business to cure him; for such a cure would have been of no use
12950 either to himself, or to the State.
12951 
12952 Then, he said, you regard Asclepius as a statesman.
12953 
12954 Clearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons. Note that
12955 they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which
12956 I am speaking at the siege of Troy: You will remember how, when Pandarus
12957 wounded Menelaus, they
12958 
12959 'Sucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing remedies,'
12960 
12961 but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or
12962 drink in the case of Menelaus, any more than in the case of Eurypylus;
12963 the remedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before
12964 he was wounded was healthy and regular in his habits; and even though he
12965 did happen to drink a posset of Pramnian wine, he might get well all the
12966 same. But they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate
12967 subjects, whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others; the
12968 art of medicine was not designed for their good, and though they were as
12969 rich as Midas, the sons of Asclepius would have declined to attend them.
12970 
12971 They were very acute persons, those sons of Asclepius.
12972 
12973 Naturally so, I replied. Nevertheless, the tragedians and Pindar
12974 disobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that Asclepius was the
12975 son of Apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man
12976 who was at the point of death, and for this reason he was struck by
12977 lightning. But we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed by
12978 us, will not believe them when they tell us both;--if he was the son of
12979 a god, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was avaricious,
12980 he was not the son of a god.
12981 
12982 All that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question to
12983 you: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not the
12984 best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good
12985 and bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are
12986 acquainted with all sorts of moral natures?
12987 
12988 Yes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians. But do
12989 you know whom I think good?
12990 
12991 Will you tell me?
12992 
12993 I will, if I can. Let me however note that in the same question you join
12994 two things which are not the same.
12995 
12996 How so? he asked.
12997 
12998 Why, I said, you join physicians and judges. Now the most skilful
12999 physicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with
13000 the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease; they
13001 had better not be robust in health, and should have had all manner of
13002 diseases in their own persons. For the body, as I conceive, is not the
13003 instrument with which they cure the body; in that case we could not
13004 allow them ever to be or to have been sickly; but they cure the body
13005 with the mind, and the mind which has become and is sick can cure
13006 nothing.
13007 
13008 That is very true, he said.
13009 
13010 But with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; he
13011 ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to
13012 have associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through
13013 the whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer
13014 the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own
13015 self-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a healthy
13016 judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits
13017 when young. And this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to
13018 be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest, because they
13019 have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.
13020 
13021 Yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.
13022 
13023 Therefore, I said, the judge should not be young; he should have learned
13024 to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation
13025 of the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his guide, not
13026 personal experience.
13027 
13028 Yes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.
13029 
13030 Yes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your
13031 question); for he is good who has a good soul. But the cunning and
13032 suspicious nature of which we spoke,--he who has committed many crimes,
13033 and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst
13034 his fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he
13035 judges of them by himself: but when he gets into the company of men of
13036 virtue, who have the experience of age, he appears to be a fool again,
13037 owing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest man,
13038 because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time, as
13039 the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them oftener,
13040 he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise than
13041 foolish.
13042 
13043 Most true, he said.
13044 
13045 Then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but
13046 the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,
13047 educated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the
13048 virtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom--in my opinion.
13049 
13050 And in mine also.
13051 
13052 This is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you
13053 will sanction in your state. They will minister to better natures,
13054 giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in
13055 their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls
13056 they will put an end to themselves.
13057 
13058 That is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the State.
13059 
13060 And thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music
13061 which, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.
13062 
13063 Clearly.
13064 
13065 And the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to practise
13066 the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine unless in
13067 some extreme case.
13068 
13069 That I quite believe.
13070 
13071 The very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to
13072 stimulate the spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his
13073 strength; he will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen to
13074 develope his muscles.
13075 
13076 Very right, he said.
13077 
13078 Neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as is
13079 often supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other for the
13080 training of the body.
13081 
13082 What then is the real object of them?
13083 
13084 I believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the
13085 improvement of the soul.
13086 
13087 How can that be? he asked.
13088 
13089 Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of
13090 exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive
13091 devotion to music?
13092 
13093 In what way shown? he said.
13094 
13095 The one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of
13096 softness and effeminacy, I replied.
13097 
13098 Yes, he said, I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of
13099 a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what
13100 is good for him.
13101 
13102 Yet surely, I said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if
13103 rightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is
13104 liable to become hard and brutal.
13105 
13106 That I quite think.
13107 
13108 On the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.
13109 And this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if
13110 educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.
13111 
13112 True.
13113 
13114 And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?
13115 
13116 Assuredly.
13117 
13118 And both should be in harmony?
13119 
13120 Beyond question.
13121 
13122 And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?
13123 
13124 Yes.
13125 
13126 And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?
13127 
13128 Very true.
13129 
13130 And, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul
13131 through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs
13132 of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in
13133 warbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process
13134 the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made
13135 useful, instead of brittle and useless. But, if he carries on the
13136 softening and soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt and
13137 waste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his
13138 soul; and he becomes a feeble warrior.
13139 
13140 Very true.
13141 
13142 If the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily
13143 accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of music
13144 weakening the spirit renders him excitable;--on the least provocation
13145 he flames up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead of having
13146 spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable.
13147 
13148 Exactly.
13149 
13150 And so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great
13151 feeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at
13152 first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit,
13153 and he becomes twice the man that he was.
13154 
13155 Certainly.
13156 
13157 And what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no converse with the
13158 Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him, having
13159 no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture,
13160 grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving
13161 nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?
13162 
13163 True, he said.
13164 
13165 And he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never using
13166 the weapon of persuasion,--he is like a wild beast, all violence and
13167 fierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all
13168 ignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.
13169 
13170 That is quite true, he said.
13171 
13172 And as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited
13173 and the other the philosophical, some God, as I should say, has given
13174 mankind two arts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul
13175 and body), in order that these two principles (like the strings of
13176 an instrument) may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly
13177 harmonized.
13178 
13179 That appears to be the intention.
13180 
13181 And he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions, and
13182 best attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true musician
13183 and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings.
13184 
13185 You are quite right, Socrates.
13186 
13187 And such a presiding genius will be always required in our State if the
13188 government is to last.
13189 
13190 Yes, he will be absolutely necessary.
13191 
13192 Such, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where would be
13193 the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens,
13194 or about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian
13195 contests? For these all follow the general principle, and having found
13196 that, we shall have no difficulty in discovering them.
13197 
13198 I dare say that there will be no difficulty.
13199 
13200 Very good, I said; then what is the next question? Must we not ask who
13201 are to be rulers and who subjects?
13202 
13203 Certainly.
13204 
13205 There can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger.
13206 
13207 Clearly.
13208 
13209 And that the best of these must rule.
13210 
13211 That is also clear.
13212 
13213 Now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to
13214 husbandry?
13215 
13216 Yes.
13217 
13218 And as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they not
13219 be those who have most the character of guardians?
13220 
13221 Yes.
13222 
13223 And to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a
13224 special care of the State?
13225 
13226 True.
13227 
13228 And a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?
13229 
13230 To be sure.
13231 
13232 And he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the
13233 same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune
13234 is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?
13235 
13236 Very true, he replied.
13237 
13238 Then there must be a selection. Let us note among the guardians those
13239 who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for
13240 the good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is
13241 against her interests.
13242 
13243 Those are the right men.
13244 
13245 And they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may see
13246 whether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence
13247 either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty
13248 to the State.
13249 
13250 How cast off? he said.
13251 
13252 I will explain to you, I replied. A resolution may go out of a man's
13253 mind either with his will or against his will; with his will when he
13254 gets rid of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever he
13255 is deprived of a truth.
13256 
13257 I understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning of
13258 the unwilling I have yet to learn.
13259 
13260 Why, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good,
13261 and willingly of evil? Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to
13262 possess the truth a good? and you would agree that to conceive things as
13263 they are is to possess the truth?
13264 
13265 Yes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived
13266 of truth against their will.
13267 
13268 And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or
13269 force, or enchantment?
13270 
13271 Still, he replied, I do not understand you.
13272 
13273 I fear that I must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. I only
13274 mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget;
13275 argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the other; and
13276 this I call theft. Now you understand me?
13277 
13278 Yes.
13279 
13280 Those again who are forced, are those whom the violence of some pain or
13281 grief compels to change their opinion.
13282 
13283 I understand, he said, and you are quite right.
13284 
13285 And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change
13286 their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the
13287 sterner influence of fear?
13288 
13289 Yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.
13290 
13291 Therefore, as I was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best
13292 guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest
13293 of the State is to be the rule of their lives. We must watch them from
13294 their youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are
13295 most likely to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is
13296 not deceived is to be selected, and he who fails in the trial is to be
13297 rejected. That will be the way?
13298 
13299 Yes.
13300 
13301 And there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for
13302 them, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same
13303 qualities.
13304 
13305 Very right, he replied.
13306 
13307 And then, I said, we must try them with enchantments--that is the third
13308 sort of test--and see what will be their behaviour: like those who take
13309 colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so
13310 must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them
13311 into pleasures, and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in
13312 the furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against
13313 all enchantments, and of a noble bearing always, good guardians of
13314 themselves and of the music which they have learned, and retaining under
13315 all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as will be
13316 most serviceable to the individual and to the State. And he who at every
13317 age, as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of the trial
13318 victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the
13319 State; he shall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive
13320 sepulture and other memorials of honour, the greatest that we have to
13321 give. But him who fails, we must reject. I am inclined to think that
13322 this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be
13323 chosen and appointed. I speak generally, and not with any pretension to
13324 exactness.
13325 
13326 And, speaking generally, I agree with you, he said.
13327 
13328 And perhaps the word 'guardian' in the fullest sense ought to be applied
13329 to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and
13330 maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may not have the
13331 will, or the others the power, to harm us. The young men whom we
13332 before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and
13333 supporters of the principles of the rulers.
13334 
13335 I agree with you, he said.
13336 
13337 How then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we
13338 lately spoke--just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if that
13339 be possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?
13340 
13341 What sort of lie? he said.
13342 
13343 Nothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician tale (Laws) of what has
13344 often occurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have
13345 made the world believe,) though not in our time, and I do not know
13346 whether such an event could ever happen again, or could now even be made
13347 probable, if it did.
13348 
13349 How your words seem to hesitate on your lips!
13350 
13351 You will not wonder, I replied, at my hesitation when you have heard.
13352 
13353 Speak, he said, and fear not.
13354 
13355 Well then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look you
13356 in the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which
13357 I propose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the
13358 soldiers, and lastly to the people. They are to be told that their youth
13359 was a dream, and the education and training which they received from
13360 us, an appearance only; in reality during all that time they were being
13361 formed and fed in the womb of the earth, where they themselves and their
13362 arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were completed, the
13363 earth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their country being their
13364 mother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise for her good, and
13365 to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are to regard as
13366 children of the earth and their own brothers.
13367 
13368 You had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you were
13369 going to tell.
13370 
13371 True, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you half.
13372 Citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet God
13373 has framed you differently. Some of you have the power of command, and
13374 in the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also
13375 they have the greatest honour; others he has made of silver, to be
13376 auxiliaries; others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has
13377 composed of brass and iron; and the species will generally be preserved
13378 in the children. But as all are of the same original stock, a golden
13379 parent will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden
13380 son. And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above all
13381 else, that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard, or of
13382 which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the race.
13383 They should observe what elements mingle in their offspring; for if the
13384 son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron,
13385 then nature orders a transposition of ranks, and the eye of the ruler
13386 must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the
13387 scale and become a husbandman or artisan, just as there may be sons of
13388 artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised
13389 to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries. For an oracle says that
13390 when a man of brass or iron guards the State, it will be destroyed. Such
13391 is the tale; is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in
13392 it?
13393 
13394 Not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of
13395 accomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale,
13396 and their sons' sons, and posterity after them.
13397 
13398 I see the difficulty, I replied; yet the fostering of such a belief will
13399 make them care more for the city and for one another. Enough, however,
13400 of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour, while
13401 we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under the command of
13402 their rulers. Let them look round and select a spot whence they can best
13403 suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory within, and also defend
13404 themselves against enemies, who like wolves may come down on the fold
13405 from without; there let them encamp, and when they have encamped, let
13406 them sacrifice to the proper Gods and prepare their dwellings.
13407 
13408 Just so, he said.
13409 
13410 And their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of
13411 winter and the heat of summer.
13412 
13413 I suppose that you mean houses, he replied.
13414 
13415 Yes, I said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of
13416 shop-keepers.
13417 
13418 What is the difference? he said.
13419 
13420 That I will endeavour to explain, I replied. To keep watch-dogs, who,
13421 from want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit or other, would
13422 turn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not like dogs but wolves,
13423 would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?
13424 
13425 Truly monstrous, he said.
13426 
13427 And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being
13428 stronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and
13429 become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?
13430 
13431 Yes, great care should be taken.
13432 
13433 And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?
13434 
13435 But they are well-educated already, he replied.
13436 
13437 I cannot be so confident, my dear Glaucon, I said; I am much more
13438 certain that they ought to be, and that true education, whatever that
13439 may be, will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them
13440 in their relations to one another, and to those who are under their
13441 protection.
13442 
13443 Very true, he replied.
13444 
13445 And not only their education, but their habitations, and all that
13446 belongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as
13447 guardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. Any man of
13448 sense must acknowledge that.
13449 
13450 He must.
13451 
13452 Then now let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to
13453 realize our idea of them. In the first place, none of them should have
13454 any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither
13455 should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has
13456 a mind to enter; their provisions should be only such as are required
13457 by trained warriors, who are men of temperance and courage; they should
13458 agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay, enough to meet
13459 the expenses of the year and no more; and they will go to mess and live
13460 together like soldiers in a camp. Gold and silver we will tell them
13461 that they have from God; the diviner metal is within them, and they have
13462 therefore no need of the dross which is current among men, and ought not
13463 to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture; for that commoner
13464 metal has been the source of many unholy deeds, but their own is
13465 undefiled. And they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle
13466 silver or gold, or be under the same roof with them, or wear them, or
13467 drink from them. And this will be their salvation, and they will be the
13468 saviours of the State. But should they ever acquire homes or lands
13469 or moneys of their own, they will become housekeepers and husbandmen
13470 instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other
13471 citizens; hating and being hated, plotting and being plotted against,
13472 they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than
13473 of external enemies, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves and to the
13474 rest of the State, will be at hand. For all which reasons may we not
13475 say that thus shall our State be ordered, and that these shall be the
13476 regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and
13477 all other matters?
13478 
13479 Yes, said Glaucon.
13480 
13481 
13482 
13483 
13484 BOOK IV.
13485 
13486 Here Adeimantus interposed a question: How would you answer, Socrates,
13487 said he, if a person were to say that you are making these people
13488 miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the
13489 city in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it;
13490 whereas other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses,
13491 and have everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the gods
13492 on their own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as you were
13493 saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual among
13494 the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better than
13495 mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard?
13496 
13497 Yes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid in
13498 addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if
13499 they would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on
13500 a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is
13501 thought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature
13502 might be added.
13503 
13504 But, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.
13505 
13506 You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?
13507 
13508 Yes.
13509 
13510 If we proceed along the old path, my belief, I said, is that we shall
13511 find the answer. And our answer will be that, even as they are, our
13512 guardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in
13513 founding the State was not the disproportionate happiness of any one
13514 class, but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a
13515 State which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should
13516 be most likely to find justice, and in the ill-ordered State injustice:
13517 and, having found them, we might then decide which of the two is the
13518 happier. At present, I take it, we are fashioning the happy State,
13519 not piecemeal, or with a view of making a few happy citizens, but as a
13520 whole; and by-and-by we will proceed to view the opposite kind of State.
13521 Suppose that we were painting a statue, and some one came up to us
13522 and said, Why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most
13523 beautiful parts of the body--the eyes ought to be purple, but you have
13524 made them black--to him we might fairly answer, Sir, you would not
13525 surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no
13526 longer eyes; consider rather whether, by giving this and the other
13527 features their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful. And so I say
13528 to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness
13529 which will make them anything but guardians; for we too can clothe our
13530 husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns of gold on their heads, and
13531 bid them till the ground as much as they like, and no more. Our potters
13532 also might be allowed to repose on couches, and feast by the fireside,
13533 passing round the winecup, while their wheel is conveniently at hand,
13534 and working at pottery only as much as they like; in this way we might
13535 make every class happy--and then, as you imagine, the whole State would
13536 be happy. But do not put this idea into our heads; for, if we listen
13537 to you, the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman, the potter will
13538 cease to be a potter, and no one will have the character of any distinct
13539 class in the State. Now this is not of much consequence where the
13540 corruption of society, and pretension to be what you are not, is
13541 confined to cobblers; but when the guardians of the laws and of the
13542 government are only seeming and not real guardians, then see how they
13543 turn the State upside down; and on the other hand they alone have the
13544 power of giving order and happiness to the State. We mean our guardians
13545 to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the State, whereas our
13546 opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival, who are enjoying a life
13547 of revelry, not of citizens who are doing their duty to the State. But,
13548 if so, we mean different things, and he is speaking of something which
13549 is not a State. And therefore we must consider whether in appointing
13550 our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually, or
13551 whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the State
13552 as a whole. But if the latter be the truth, then the guardians and
13553 auxiliaries, and all others equally with them, must be compelled or
13554 induced to do their own work in the best way. And thus the whole State
13555 will grow up in a noble order, and the several classes will receive the
13556 proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them.
13557 
13558 I think that you are quite right.
13559 
13560 I wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me.
13561 
13562 What may that be?
13563 
13564 There seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.
13565 
13566 What are they?
13567 
13568 Wealth, I said, and poverty.
13569 
13570 How do they act?
13571 
13572 The process is as follows: When a potter becomes rich, will he, think
13573 you, any longer take the same pains with his art?
13574 
13575 Certainly not.
13576 
13577 He will grow more and more indolent and careless?
13578 
13579 Very true.
13580 
13581 And the result will be that he becomes a worse potter?
13582 
13583 Yes; he greatly deteriorates.
13584 
13585 But, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself
13586 with tools or instruments, he will not work equally well himself, nor
13587 will he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.
13588 
13589 Certainly not.
13590 
13591 Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and
13592 their work are equally liable to degenerate?
13593 
13594 That is evident.
13595 
13596 Here, then, is a discovery of new evils, I said, against which
13597 the guardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city
13598 unobserved.
13599 
13600 What evils?
13601 
13602 Wealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and
13603 indolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of
13604 discontent.
13605 
13606 That is very true, he replied; but still I should like to know,
13607 Socrates, how our city will be able to go to war, especially against an
13608 enemy who is rich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of war.
13609 
13610 There would certainly be a difficulty, I replied, in going to war with
13611 one such enemy; but there is no difficulty where there are two of them.
13612 
13613 How so? he asked.
13614 
13615 In the first place, I said, if we have to fight, our side will be
13616 trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men.
13617 
13618 That is true, he said.
13619 
13620 And do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was
13621 perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do
13622 gentlemen who were not boxers?
13623 
13624 Hardly, if they came upon him at once.
13625 
13626 What, now, I said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike
13627 at the one who first came up? And supposing he were to do this several
13628 times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert,
13629 overturn more than one stout personage?
13630 
13631 Certainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.
13632 
13633 And yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and
13634 practise of boxing than they have in military qualities.
13635 
13636 Likely enough.
13637 
13638 Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or
13639 three times their own number?
13640 
13641 I agree with you, for I think you right.
13642 
13643 And suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to one
13644 of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we
13645 neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore
13646 come and help us in war, and take the spoils of the other city: Who,
13647 on hearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs,
13648 rather than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?
13649 
13650 That is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the poor State if
13651 the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one.
13652 
13653 But how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our own!
13654 
13655 Why so?
13656 
13657 You ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one of
13658 them is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game. For indeed any
13659 city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of the
13660 poor, the other of the rich; these are at war with one another; and in
13661 either there are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether
13662 beside the mark if you treated them all as a single State. But if you
13663 deal with them as many, and give the wealth or power or persons of the
13664 one to the others, you will always have a great many friends and not
13665 many enemies. And your State, while the wise order which has now been
13666 prescribed continues to prevail in her, will be the greatest of States,
13667 I do not mean to say in reputation or appearance, but in deed and truth,
13668 though she number not more than a thousand defenders. A single State
13669 which is her equal you will hardly find, either among Hellenes or
13670 barbarians, though many that appear to be as great and many times
13671 greater.
13672 
13673 That is most true, he said.
13674 
13675 And what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they
13676 are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory which
13677 they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?
13678 
13679 What limit would you propose?
13680 
13681 I would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity;
13682 that, I think, is the proper limit.
13683 
13684 Very good, he said.
13685 
13686 Here then, I said, is another order which will have to be conveyed to
13687 our guardians: Let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but
13688 one and self-sufficing.
13689 
13690 And surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose
13691 upon them.
13692 
13693 And the other, said I, of which we were speaking before is lighter
13694 still,--I mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when
13695 inferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of
13696 the lower classes, when naturally superior. The intention was, that, in
13697 the case of the citizens generally, each individual should be put to the
13698 use for which nature intended him, one to one work, and then every man
13699 would do his own business, and be one and not many; and so the whole
13700 city would be one and not many.
13701 
13702 Yes, he said; that is not so difficult.
13703 
13704 The regulations which we are prescribing, my good Adeimantus, are not,
13705 as might be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles all,
13706 if care be taken, as the saying is, of the one great thing,--a thing,
13707 however, which I would rather call, not great, but sufficient for our
13708 purpose.
13709 
13710 What may that be? he asked.
13711 
13712 Education, I said, and nurture: If our citizens are well educated,
13713 and grow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all
13714 these, as well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as
13715 marriage, the possession of women and the procreation of children, which
13716 will all follow the general principle that friends have all things in
13717 common, as the proverb says.
13718 
13719 That will be the best way of settling them.
13720 
13721 Also, I said, the State, if once started well, moves with accumulating
13722 force like a wheel. For good nurture and education implant good
13723 constitutions, and these good constitutions taking root in a good
13724 education improve more and more, and this improvement affects the breed
13725 in man as in other animals.
13726 
13727 Very possibly, he said.
13728 
13729 Then to sum up: This is the point to which, above all, the attention of
13730 our rulers should be directed,--that music and gymnastic be preserved in
13731 their original form, and no innovation made. They must do their utmost
13732 to maintain them intact. And when any one says that mankind most regard
13733 
13734 'The newest song which the singers have,'
13735 
13736 they will be afraid that he may be praising, not new songs, but a new
13737 kind of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the
13738 meaning of the poet; for any musical innovation is full of danger to the
13739 whole State, and ought to be prohibited. So Damon tells me, and I
13740 can quite believe him;--he says that when modes of music change, the
13741 fundamental laws of the State always change with them.
13742 
13743 Yes, said Adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to Damon's and your
13744 own.
13745 
13746 Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress
13747 in music?
13748 
13749 Yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.
13750 
13751 Yes, I replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears
13752 harmless.
13753 
13754 Why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by
13755 little this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates
13756 into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades
13757 contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws and
13758 constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last, Socrates, by an
13759 overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.
13760 
13761 Is that true? I said.
13762 
13763 That is my belief, he replied.
13764 
13765 Then, as I was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in
13766 a stricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and the youths
13767 themselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted
13768 and virtuous citizens.
13769 
13770 Very true, he said.
13771 
13772 And when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help of
13773 music have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in
13774 a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them
13775 in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them, and if there
13776 be any fallen places in the State will raise them up again.
13777 
13778 Very true, he said.
13779 
13780 Thus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which
13781 their predecessors have altogether neglected.
13782 
13783 What do you mean?
13784 
13785 I mean such things as these:--when the young are to be silent before
13786 their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and
13787 making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes
13788 are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in
13789 general. You would agree with me?
13790 
13791 Yes.
13792 
13793 But there is, I think, small wisdom in legislating about such
13794 matters,--I doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written
13795 enactments about them likely to be lasting.
13796 
13797 Impossible.
13798 
13799 It would seem, Adeimantus, that the direction in which education starts
13800 a man, will determine his future life. Does not like always attract
13801 like?
13802 
13803 To be sure.
13804 
13805 Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and
13806 may be the reverse of good?
13807 
13808 That is not to be denied.
13809 
13810 And for this reason, I said, I shall not attempt to legislate further
13811 about them.
13812 
13813 Naturally enough, he replied.
13814 
13815 Well, and about the business of the agora, and the ordinary dealings
13816 between man and man, or again about agreements with artisans; about
13817 insult and injury, or the commencement of actions, and the appointment
13818 of juries, what would you say? there may also arise questions about
13819 any impositions and exactions of market and harbour dues which may
13820 be required, and in general about the regulations of markets, police,
13821 harbours, and the like. But, oh heavens! shall we condescend to
13822 legislate on any of these particulars?
13823 
13824 I think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them on
13825 good men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough
13826 for themselves.
13827 
13828 Yes, I said, my friend, if God will only preserve to them the laws which
13829 we have given them.
13830 
13831 And without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever
13832 making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining
13833 perfection.
13834 
13835 You would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no
13836 self-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?
13837 
13838 Exactly.
13839 
13840 Yes, I said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always
13841 doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always
13842 fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises
13843 them to try.
13844 
13845 Such cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this sort.
13846 
13847 Yes, I replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst
13848 enemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless they give
13849 up eating and drinking and wenching and idling, neither drug nor cautery
13850 nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.
13851 
13852 Charming! he replied. I see nothing charming in going into a passion
13853 with a man who tells you what is right.
13854 
13855 These gentlemen, I said, do not seem to be in your good graces.
13856 
13857 Assuredly not.
13858 
13859 Nor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men whom
13860 I was just now describing. For are there not ill-ordered States in
13861 which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the
13862 constitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under
13863 this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in
13864 anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and
13865 good statesman--do not these States resemble the persons whom I was
13866 describing?
13867 
13868 Yes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far from
13869 praising them.
13870 
13871 But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these ready
13872 ministers of political corruption?
13873 
13874 Yes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom
13875 the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are
13876 really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.
13877 
13878 What do you mean? I said; you should have more feeling for them. When a
13879 man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare
13880 that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?
13881 
13882 Nay, he said, certainly not in that case.
13883 
13884 Well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a
13885 play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing; they
13886 are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds
13887 in contracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning, not
13888 knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?
13889 
13890 Yes, he said; that is just what they are doing.
13891 
13892 I conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble
13893 himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the
13894 constitution either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for
13895 in the former they are quite useless, and in the latter there will be no
13896 difficulty in devising them; and many of them will naturally flow out of
13897 our previous regulations.
13898 
13899 What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of
13900 legislation?
13901 
13902 Nothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there
13903 remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of
13904 all.
13905 
13906 Which are they? he said.
13907 
13908 The institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service of
13909 gods, demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories of
13910 the dead, and the rites which have to be observed by him who would
13911 propitiate the inhabitants of the world below. These are matters of
13912 which we are ignorant ourselves, and as founders of a city we should be
13913 unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity. He
13914 is the god who sits in the centre, on the navel of the earth, and he is
13915 the interpreter of religion to all mankind.
13916 
13917 You are right, and we will do as you propose.
13918 
13919 But where, amid all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me where. Now
13920 that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and search, and
13921 get your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help,
13922 and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice,
13923 and in what they differ from one another, and which of them the man who
13924 would be happy should have for his portion, whether seen or unseen by
13925 gods and men.
13926 
13927 Nonsense, said Glaucon: did you not promise to search yourself, saying
13928 that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?
13929 
13930 I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good as
13931 my word; but you must join.
13932 
13933 We will, he replied.
13934 
13935 Well, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way: I mean to begin
13936 with the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect.
13937 
13938 That is most certain.
13939 
13940 And being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just.
13941 
13942 That is likewise clear.
13943 
13944 And whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one which is
13945 not found will be the residue?
13946 
13947 Very good.
13948 
13949 If there were four things, and we were searching for one of them,
13950 wherever it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from the
13951 first, and there would be no further trouble; or we might know the other
13952 three first, and then the fourth would clearly be the one left.
13953 
13954 Very true, he said.
13955 
13956 And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are
13957 also four in number?
13958 
13959 Clearly.
13960 
13961 First among the virtues found in the State, wisdom comes into view, and
13962 in this I detect a certain peculiarity.
13963 
13964 What is that?
13965 
13966 The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good
13967 in counsel?
13968 
13969 Very true.
13970 
13971 And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance,
13972 but by knowledge, do men counsel well?
13973 
13974 Clearly.
13975 
13976 And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?
13977 
13978 Of course.
13979 
13980 There is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of
13981 knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?
13982 
13983 Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in
13984 carpentering.
13985 
13986 Then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge
13987 which counsels for the best about wooden implements?
13988 
13989 Certainly not.
13990 
13991 Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said,
13992 nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?
13993 
13994 Not by reason of any of them, he said.
13995 
13996 Nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would
13997 give the city the name of agricultural?
13998 
13999 Yes.
14000 
14001 Well, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently-founded State
14002 among any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing
14003 in the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State can best
14004 deal with itself and with other States?
14005 
14006 There certainly is.
14007 
14008 And what is this knowledge, and among whom is it found? I asked.
14009 
14010 It is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and is found among
14011 those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.
14012 
14013 And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this
14014 sort of knowledge?
14015 
14016 The name of good in counsel and truly wise.
14017 
14018 And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more
14019 smiths?
14020 
14021 The smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.
14022 
14023 Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a
14024 name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?
14025 
14026 Much the smallest.
14027 
14028 And so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge
14029 which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole
14030 State, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and
14031 this, which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been
14032 ordained by nature to be of all classes the least.
14033 
14034 Most true.
14035 
14036 Thus, then, I said, the nature and place in the State of one of the four
14037 virtues has somehow or other been discovered.
14038 
14039 And, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.
14040 
14041 Again, I said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage,
14042 and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous
14043 to the State.
14044 
14045 How do you mean?
14046 
14047 Why, I said, every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly, will
14048 be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the State's
14049 behalf.
14050 
14051 No one, he replied, would ever think of any other.
14052 
14053 The rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly, but their
14054 courage or cowardice will not, as I conceive, have the effect of making
14055 the city either the one or the other.
14056 
14057 Certainly not.
14058 
14059 The city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which
14060 preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of
14061 things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator
14062 educated them; and this is what you term courage.
14063 
14064 I should like to hear what you are saying once more, for I do not think
14065 that I perfectly understand you.
14066 
14067 I mean that courage is a kind of salvation.
14068 
14069 Salvation of what?
14070 
14071 Of the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of
14072 what nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by the
14073 words 'under all circumstances' to intimate that in pleasure or in pain,
14074 or under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and does not
14075 lose this opinion. Shall I give you an illustration?
14076 
14077 If you please.
14078 
14079 You know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making the
14080 true sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first; this they
14081 prepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white
14082 ground may take the purple hue in full perfection. The dyeing then
14083 proceeds; and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour,
14084 and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom.
14085 But, when the ground has not been duly prepared, you will have noticed
14086 how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour.
14087 
14088 Yes, he said; I know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous
14089 appearance.
14090 
14091 Then now, I said, you will understand what our object was in selecting
14092 our soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were
14093 contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the
14094 laws in perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and
14095 of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture
14096 and training, not to be washed away by such potent lyes as
14097 pleasure--mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye;
14098 or by sorrow, fear, and desire, the mightiest of all other solvents. And
14099 this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with
14100 law about real and false dangers I call and maintain to be courage,
14101 unless you disagree.
14102 
14103 But I agree, he replied; for I suppose that you mean to exclude mere
14104 uninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave--this,
14105 in your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to
14106 have another name.
14107 
14108 Most certainly.
14109 
14110 Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe?
14111 
14112 Why, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words 'of a citizen,'
14113 you will not be far wrong;--hereafter, if you like, we will carry the
14114 examination further, but at present we are seeking not for courage but
14115 justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.
14116 
14117 You are right, he replied.
14118 
14119 Two virtues remain to be discovered in the State--first, temperance, and
14120 then justice which is the end of our search.
14121 
14122 Very true.
14123 
14124 Now, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?
14125 
14126 I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire
14127 that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of;
14128 and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering
14129 temperance first.
14130 
14131 Certainly, I replied, I should not be justified in refusing your
14132 request.
14133 
14134 Then consider, he said.
14135 
14136 Yes, I replied; I will; and as far as I can at present see, the virtue
14137 of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the
14138 preceding.
14139 
14140 How so? he asked.
14141 
14142 Temperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain
14143 pleasures and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of
14144 'a man being his own master;' and other traces of the same notion may be
14145 found in language.
14146 
14147 No doubt, he said.
14148 
14149 There is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself;' for
14150 the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and in all
14151 these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.
14152 
14153 Certainly.
14154 
14155 The meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a better and
14156 also a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under control,
14157 then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term of
14158 praise: but when, owing to evil education or association, the better
14159 principle, which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater mass
14160 of the worse--in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self
14161 and unprincipled.
14162 
14163 Yes, there is reason in that.
14164 
14165 And now, I said, look at our newly-created State, and there you will
14166 find one of these two conditions realized; for the State, as you
14167 will acknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words
14168 'temperance' and 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better
14169 part over the worse.
14170 
14171 Yes, he said, I see that what you say is true.
14172 
14173 Let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires
14174 and pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and in
14175 the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.
14176 
14177 Certainly, he said.
14178 
14179 Whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are
14180 under the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a
14181 few, and those the best born and best educated.
14182 
14183 Very true.
14184 
14185 These two, as you may perceive, have a place in our State; and the
14186 meaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and
14187 wisdom of the few.
14188 
14189 That I perceive, he said.
14190 
14191 Then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own
14192 pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a
14193 designation?
14194 
14195 Certainly, he replied.
14196 
14197 It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?
14198 
14199 Yes.
14200 
14201 And if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as
14202 to the question who are to rule, that again will be our State?
14203 
14204 Undoubtedly.
14205 
14206 And the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class will
14207 temperance be found--in the rulers or in the subjects?
14208 
14209 In both, as I should imagine, he replied.
14210 
14211 Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance
14212 was a sort of harmony?
14213 
14214 Why so?
14215 
14216 Why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which
14217 resides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other
14218 valiant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through
14219 all the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the weaker and the
14220 stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be stronger
14221 or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or anything else.
14222 Most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the
14223 naturally superior and inferior, as to the right to rule of either, both
14224 in states and individuals.
14225 
14226 I entirely agree with you.
14227 
14228 And so, I said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to have
14229 been discovered in our State. The last of those qualities which make a
14230 state virtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that was.
14231 
14232 The inference is obvious.
14233 
14234 The time then has arrived, Glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should
14235 surround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away, and
14236 pass out of sight and escape us; for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in
14237 this country: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her, and if
14238 you see her first, let me know.
14239 
14240 Would that I could! but you should regard me rather as a follower who
14241 has just eyes enough to see what you show him--that is about as much as
14242 I am good for.
14243 
14244 Offer up a prayer with me and follow.
14245 
14246 I will, but you must show me the way.
14247 
14248 Here is no path, I said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still we
14249 must push on.
14250 
14251 Let us push on.
14252 
14253 Here I saw something: Halloo! I said, I begin to perceive a track, and I
14254 believe that the quarry will not escape.
14255 
14256 Good news, he said.
14257 
14258 Truly, I said, we are stupid fellows.
14259 
14260 Why so?
14261 
14262 Why, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there was
14263 justice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing could be
14264 more ridiculous. Like people who go about looking for what they have
14265 in their hands--that was the way with us--we looked not at what we
14266 were seeking, but at what was far off in the distance; and therefore, I
14267 suppose, we missed her.
14268 
14269 What do you mean?
14270 
14271 I mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking
14272 of justice, and have failed to recognise her.
14273 
14274 I grow impatient at the length of your exordium.
14275 
14276 Well then, tell me, I said, whether I am right or not: You remember the
14277 original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation
14278 of the State, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing to
14279 which his nature was best adapted;--now justice is this principle or a
14280 part of it.
14281 
14282 Yes, we often said that one man should do one thing only.
14283 
14284 Further, we affirmed that justice was doing one's own business, and not
14285 being a busybody; we said so again and again, and many others have said
14286 the same to us.
14287 
14288 Yes, we said so.
14289 
14290 Then to do one's own business in a certain way may be assumed to be
14291 justice. Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?
14292 
14293 I cannot, but I should like to be told.
14294 
14295 Because I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the
14296 State when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are
14297 abstracted; and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the
14298 existence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also their
14299 preservative; and we were saying that if the three were discovered by
14300 us, justice would be the fourth or remaining one.
14301 
14302 That follows of necessity.
14303 
14304 If we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its
14305 presence contributes most to the excellence of the State, whether the
14306 agreement of rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers of
14307 the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers, or
14308 wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which I am
14309 mentioning, and which is found in children and women, slave and freeman,
14310 artisan, ruler, subject,--the quality, I mean, of every one doing his
14311 own work, and not being a busybody, would claim the palm--the question
14312 is not so easily answered.
14313 
14314 Certainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.
14315 
14316 Then the power of each individual in the State to do his own work
14317 appears to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom, temperance,
14318 courage.
14319 
14320 Yes, he said.
14321 
14322 And the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?
14323 
14324 Exactly.
14325 
14326 Let us look at the question from another point of view: Are not
14327 the rulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of
14328 determining suits at law?
14329 
14330 Certainly.
14331 
14332 And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither
14333 take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?
14334 
14335 Yes; that is their principle.
14336 
14337 Which is a just principle?
14338 
14339 Yes.
14340 
14341 Then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and
14342 doing what is a man's own, and belongs to him?
14343 
14344 Very true.
14345 
14346 Think, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a
14347 carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a
14348 carpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their
14349 duties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be
14350 the change; do you think that any great harm would result to the State?
14351 
14352 Not much.
14353 
14354 But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a
14355 trader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number
14356 of his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way
14357 into the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and
14358 guardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements
14359 or the duties of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and
14360 warrior all in one, then I think you will agree with me in saying that
14361 this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of
14362 the State.
14363 
14364 Most true.
14365 
14366 Seeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling
14367 of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the greatest
14368 harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?
14369 
14370 Precisely.
14371 
14372 And the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be termed
14373 by you injustice?
14374 
14375 Certainly.
14376 
14377 This then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the
14378 auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice,
14379 and will make the city just.
14380 
14381 I agree with you.
14382 
14383 We will not, I said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this
14384 conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in
14385 the State, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not
14386 verified, we must have a fresh enquiry. First let us complete the old
14387 investigation, which we began, as you remember, under the impression
14388 that, if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale, there
14389 would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual. That
14390 larger example appeared to be the State, and accordingly we constructed
14391 as good a one as we could, knowing well that in the good State justice
14392 would be found. Let the discovery which we made be now applied to the
14393 individual--if they agree, we shall be satisfied; or, if there be a
14394 difference in the individual, we will come back to the State and
14395 have another trial of the theory. The friction of the two when rubbed
14396 together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth,
14397 and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls.
14398 
14399 That will be in regular course; let us do as you say.
14400 
14401 I proceeded to ask: When two things, a greater and less, are called by
14402 the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the
14403 same?
14404 
14405 Like, he replied.
14406 
14407 The just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like
14408 the just State?
14409 
14410 He will.
14411 
14412 And a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the
14413 State severally did their own business; and also thought to be temperate
14414 and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities
14415 of these same classes?
14416 
14417 True, he said.
14418 
14419 And so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three
14420 principles in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be
14421 rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same
14422 manner?
14423 
14424 Certainly, he said.
14425 
14426 Once more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy
14427 question--whether the soul has these three principles or not?
14428 
14429 An easy question! Nay, rather, Socrates, the proverb holds that hard is
14430 the good.
14431 
14432 Very true, I said; and I do not think that the method which we are
14433 employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question;
14434 the true method is another and a longer one. Still we may arrive at a
14435 solution not below the level of the previous enquiry.
14436 
14437 May we not be satisfied with that? he said;--under the circumstances, I
14438 am quite content.
14439 
14440 I too, I replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.
14441 
14442 Then faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.
14443 
14444 Must we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there are the same
14445 principles and habits which there are in the State; and that from the
14446 individual they pass into the State?--how else can they come there? Take
14447 the quality of passion or spirit;--it would be ridiculous to imagine
14448 that this quality, when found in States, is not derived from the
14449 individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the Thracians,
14450 Scythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be said
14451 of the love of knowledge, which is the special characteristic of our
14452 part of the world, or of the love of money, which may, with equal truth,
14453 be attributed to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.
14454 
14455 Exactly so, he said.
14456 
14457 There is no difficulty in understanding this.
14458 
14459 None whatever.
14460 
14461 But the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether
14462 these principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn
14463 with one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third
14464 part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether the
14465 whole soul comes into play in each sort of action--to determine that is
14466 the difficulty.
14467 
14468 Yes, he said; there lies the difficulty.
14469 
14470 Then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or
14471 different.
14472 
14473 How can we? he asked.
14474 
14475 I replied as follows: The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon
14476 in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time,
14477 in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in
14478 things apparently the same, we know that they are really not the same,
14479 but different.
14480 
14481 Good.
14482 
14483 For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the
14484 same time in the same part?
14485 
14486 Impossible.
14487 
14488 Still, I said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest we
14489 should hereafter fall out by the way. Imagine the case of a man who is
14490 standing and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose a person
14491 to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same
14492 moment--to such a mode of speech we should object, and should rather say
14493 that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest.
14494 
14495 Very true.
14496 
14497 And suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the nice
14498 distinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when they spin
14499 round with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and in motion at
14500 the same time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the
14501 same spot), his objection would not be admitted by us, because in
14502 such cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of
14503 themselves; we should rather say that they have both an axis and a
14504 circumference, and that the axis stands still, for there is no deviation
14505 from the perpendicular; and that the circumference goes round. But if,
14506 while revolving, the axis inclines either to the right or left, forwards
14507 or backwards, then in no point of view can they be at rest.
14508 
14509 That is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.
14510 
14511 Then none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe
14512 that the same thing at the same time, in the same part or in relation to
14513 the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.
14514 
14515 Certainly not, according to my way of thinking.
14516 
14517 Yet, I said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such
14518 objections, and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume
14519 their absurdity, and go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if
14520 this assumption turn out to be untrue, all the consequences which follow
14521 shall be withdrawn.
14522 
14523 Yes, he said, that will be the best way.
14524 
14525 Well, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire and
14526 aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether
14527 they are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in
14528 the fact of their opposition)?
14529 
14530 Yes, he said, they are opposites.
14531 
14532 Well, I said, and hunger and thirst, and the desires in general, and
14533 again willing and wishing,--all these you would refer to the classes
14534 already mentioned. You would say--would you not?--that the soul of him
14535 who desires is seeking after the object of his desire; or that he is
14536 drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess: or again,
14537 when a person wants anything to be given him, his mind, longing for the
14538 realization of his desire, intimates his wish to have it by a nod of
14539 assent, as if he had been asked a question?
14540 
14541 Very true.
14542 
14543 And what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of
14544 desire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion
14545 and rejection?
14546 
14547 Certainly.
14548 
14549 Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a
14550 particular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and
14551 thirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?
14552 
14553 Let us take that class, he said.
14554 
14555 The object of one is food, and of the other drink?
14556 
14557 Yes.
14558 
14559 And here comes the point: is not thirst the desire which the soul has of
14560 drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else; for
14561 example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of any
14562 particular sort: but if the thirst be accompanied by heat, then the
14563 desire is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm drink;
14564 or, if the thirst be excessive, then the drink which is desired will be
14565 excessive; or, if not great, the quantity of drink will also be small:
14566 but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple, which is
14567 the natural satisfaction of thirst, as food is of hunger?
14568 
14569 Yes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the
14570 simple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.
14571 
14572 But here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against an
14573 opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but good
14574 drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal object of
14575 desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst after good
14576 drink; and the same is true of every other desire.
14577 
14578 Yes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.
14579 
14580 Nevertheless I should still maintain, that of relatives some have a
14581 quality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple and
14582 have their correlatives simple.
14583 
14584 I do not know what you mean.
14585 
14586 Well, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?
14587 
14588 Certainly.
14589 
14590 And the much greater to the much less?
14591 
14592 Yes.
14593 
14594 And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is
14595 to be to the less that is to be?
14596 
14597 Certainly, he said.
14598 
14599 And so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the
14600 double and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter
14601 and the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives;--is not
14602 this true of all of them?
14603 
14604 Yes.
14605 
14606 And does not the same principle hold in the sciences? The object of
14607 science is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but
14608 the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge;
14609 I mean, for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of
14610 knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is
14611 therefore termed architecture.
14612 
14613 Certainly.
14614 
14615 Because it has a particular quality which no other has?
14616 
14617 Yes.
14618 
14619 And it has this particular quality because it has an object of a
14620 particular kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?
14621 
14622 Yes.
14623 
14624 Now, then, if I have made myself clear, you will understand my original
14625 meaning in what I said about relatives. My meaning was, that if one term
14626 of a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one term
14627 is qualified, the other is also qualified. I do not mean to say that
14628 relatives may not be disparate, or that the science of health is
14629 healthy, or of disease necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of
14630 good and evil are therefore good and evil; but only that, when the term
14631 science is no longer used absolutely, but has a qualified object which
14632 in this case is the nature of health and disease, it becomes defined,
14633 and is hence called not merely science, but the science of medicine.
14634 
14635 I quite understand, and I think as you do.
14636 
14637 Would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative
14638 terms, having clearly a relation--
14639 
14640 Yes, thirst is relative to drink.
14641 
14642 And a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink; but
14643 thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor bad,
14644 nor of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?
14645 
14646 Certainly.
14647 
14648 Then the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, desires
14649 only drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it?
14650 
14651 That is plain.
14652 
14653 And if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink,
14654 that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like
14655 a beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing cannot at the
14656 same time with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the
14657 same.
14658 
14659 Impossible.
14660 
14661 No more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the
14662 bow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes and the
14663 other pulls.
14664 
14665 Exactly so, he replied.
14666 
14667 And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?
14668 
14669 Yes, he said, it constantly happens.
14670 
14671 And in such a case what is one to say? Would you not say that there
14672 was something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else
14673 forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which
14674 bids him?
14675 
14676 I should say so.
14677 
14678 And the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which bids
14679 and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?
14680 
14681 Clearly.
14682 
14683 Then we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ from
14684 one another; the one with which a man reasons, we may call the rational
14685 principle of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and
14686 thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire, may be termed
14687 the irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and
14688 satisfactions?
14689 
14690 Yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.
14691 
14692 Then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in
14693 the soul. And what of passion, or spirit? Is it a third, or akin to one
14694 of the preceding?
14695 
14696 I should be inclined to say--akin to desire.
14697 
14698 Well, I said, there is a story which I remember to have heard, and in
14699 which I put faith. The story is, that Leontius, the son of Aglaion,
14700 coming up one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the outside,
14701 observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution.
14702 He felt a desire to see them, and also a dread and abhorrence of them;
14703 for a time he struggled and covered his eyes, but at length the desire
14704 got the better of him; and forcing them open, he ran up to the dead
14705 bodies, saying, Look, ye wretches, take your fill of the fair sight.
14706 
14707 I have heard the story myself, he said.
14708 
14709 The moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire,
14710 as though they were two distinct things.
14711 
14712 Yes; that is the meaning, he said.
14713 
14714 And are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a man's
14715 desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself, and is
14716 angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle, which is
14717 like the struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on the side of
14718 his reason;--but for the passionate or spirited element to take part
14719 with the desires when reason decides that she should not be opposed,
14720 is a sort of thing which I believe that you never observed occurring in
14721 yourself, nor, as I should imagine, in any one else?
14722 
14723 Certainly not.
14724 
14725 Suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the nobler
14726 he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such as
14727 hunger, or cold, or any other pain which the injured person may inflict
14728 upon him--these he deems to be just, and, as I say, his anger refuses to
14729 be excited by them.
14730 
14731 True, he said.
14732 
14733 But when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils
14734 and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and
14735 because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more
14736 determined to persevere and conquer. His noble spirit will not be
14737 quelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice
14738 of the shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.
14739 
14740 The illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our State, as we were
14741 saying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of the
14742 rulers, who are their shepherds.
14743 
14744 I perceive, I said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, a
14745 further point which I wish you to consider.
14746 
14747 What point?
14748 
14749 You remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind
14750 of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict
14751 of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle.
14752 
14753 Most assuredly.
14754 
14755 But a further question arises: Is passion different from reason also, or
14756 only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three principles
14757 in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the concupiscent;
14758 or rather, as the State was composed of three classes, traders,
14759 auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the individual soul a
14760 third element which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by bad
14761 education is the natural auxiliary of reason?
14762 
14763 Yes, he said, there must be a third.
14764 
14765 Yes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different
14766 from desire, turn out also to be different from reason.
14767 
14768 But that is easily proved:--We may observe even in young children that
14769 they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some
14770 of them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them late
14771 enough.
14772 
14773 Excellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals,
14774 which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. And we may
14775 once more appeal to the words of Homer, which have been already quoted
14776 by us,
14777 
14778 'He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul,'
14779 
14780 for in this verse Homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons
14781 about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger
14782 which is rebuked by it.
14783 
14784 Very true, he said.
14785 
14786 And so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed
14787 that the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the
14788 individual, and that they are three in number.
14789 
14790 Exactly.
14791 
14792 Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and
14793 in virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?
14794 
14795 Certainly.
14796 
14797 Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State
14798 constitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and the
14799 individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?
14800 
14801 Assuredly.
14802 
14803 And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way
14804 in which the State is just?
14805 
14806 That follows, of course.
14807 
14808 We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each
14809 of the three classes doing the work of its own class?
14810 
14811 We are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.
14812 
14813 We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of
14814 his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?
14815 
14816 Yes, he said, we must remember that too.
14817 
14818 And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of
14819 the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be
14820 the subject and ally?
14821 
14822 Certainly.
14823 
14824 And, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic will
14825 bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble
14826 words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the
14827 wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?
14828 
14829 Quite true, he said.
14830 
14831 And these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly to
14832 know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in each
14833 of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of
14834 gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong with
14835 the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the concupiscent
14836 soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave
14837 and rule those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn the
14838 whole life of man?
14839 
14840 Very true, he said.
14841 
14842 Both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and
14843 the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and
14844 the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his
14845 commands and counsels?
14846 
14847 True.
14848 
14849 And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and
14850 in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear?
14851 
14852 Right, he replied.
14853 
14854 And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and
14855 which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a
14856 knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of
14857 the whole?
14858 
14859 Assuredly.
14860 
14861 And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements
14862 in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and
14863 the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason
14864 ought to rule, and do not rebel?
14865 
14866 Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in
14867 the State or individual.
14868 
14869 And surely, I said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue
14870 of what quality a man will be just.
14871 
14872 That is very certain.
14873 
14874 And is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or
14875 is she the same which we found her to be in the State?
14876 
14877 There is no difference in my opinion, he said.
14878 
14879 Because, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few commonplace
14880 instances will satisfy us of the truth of what I am saying.
14881 
14882 What sort of instances do you mean?
14883 
14884 If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or
14885 the man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less
14886 likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?
14887 Would any one deny this?
14888 
14889 No one, he replied.
14890 
14891 Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, or
14892 treachery either to his friends or to his country?
14893 
14894 Never.
14895 
14896 Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or
14897 agreements?
14898 
14899 Impossible.
14900 
14901 No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his
14902 father and mother, or to fail in his religious duties?
14903 
14904 No one.
14905 
14906 And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,
14907 whether in ruling or being ruled?
14908 
14909 Exactly so.
14910 
14911 Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such
14912 states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?
14913 
14914 Not I, indeed.
14915 
14916 Then our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we entertained
14917 at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power
14918 must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been
14919 verified?
14920 
14921 Yes, certainly.
14922 
14923 And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the
14924 shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own
14925 business, and not another's, was a shadow of justice, and for that
14926 reason it was of use?
14927 
14928 Clearly.
14929 
14930 But in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned
14931 however, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the
14932 true self and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit the
14933 several elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of
14934 them to do the work of others,--he sets in order his own inner life, and
14935 is his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself; and when
14936 he has bound together the three principles within him, which may be
14937 compared to the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale, and the
14938 intermediate intervals--when he has bound all these together, and is
14939 no longer many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly
14940 adjusted nature, then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether in
14941 a matter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some affair
14942 of politics or private business; always thinking and calling that which
14943 preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition, just and good
14944 action, and the knowledge which presides over it, wisdom, and that which
14945 at any time impairs this condition, he will call unjust action, and the
14946 opinion which presides over it ignorance.
14947 
14948 You have said the exact truth, Socrates.
14949 
14950 Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man
14951 and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should
14952 not be telling a falsehood?
14953 
14954 Most certainly not.
14955 
14956 May we say so, then?
14957 
14958 Let us say so.
14959 
14960 And now, I said, injustice has to be considered.
14961 
14962 Clearly.
14963 
14964 Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three
14965 principles--a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part
14966 of the soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which
14967 is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the
14968 natural vassal,--what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice,
14969 and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every form of vice?
14970 
14971 Exactly so.
14972 
14973 And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning of
14974 acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will also
14975 be perfectly clear?
14976 
14977 What do you mean? he said.
14978 
14979 Why, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just
14980 what disease and health are in the body.
14981 
14982 How so? he said.
14983 
14984 Why, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is
14985 unhealthy causes disease.
14986 
14987 Yes.
14988 
14989 And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?
14990 
14991 That is certain.
14992 
14993 And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and
14994 government of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation
14995 of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this
14996 natural order?
14997 
14998 True.
14999 
15000 And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order
15001 and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the
15002 creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance
15003 with the natural order?
15004 
15005 Exactly so, he said.
15006 
15007 Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and
15008 vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?
15009 
15010 True.
15011 
15012 And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?
15013 
15014 Assuredly.
15015 
15016 Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and
15017 injustice has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to be
15018 just and act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of
15019 gods and men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and
15020 unreformed?
15021 
15022 In my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous. We
15023 know that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer
15024 endurable, though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and
15025 having all wealth and all power; and shall we be told that when the
15026 very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted, life
15027 is still worth having to a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he
15028 likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and
15029 virtue, or to escape from injustice and vice; assuming them both to be
15030 such as we have described?
15031 
15032 Yes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. Still, as we are
15033 near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with
15034 our own eyes, let us not faint by the way.
15035 
15036 Certainly not, he replied.
15037 
15038 Come up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, those of
15039 them, I mean, which are worth looking at.
15040 
15041 I am following you, he replied: proceed.
15042 
15043 I said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as from
15044 some tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue
15045 is one, but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four
15046 special ones which are deserving of note.
15047 
15048 What do you mean? he said.
15049 
15050 I mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as
15051 there are distinct forms of the State.
15052 
15053 How many?
15054 
15055 There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said.
15056 
15057 What are they?
15058 
15059 The first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which may
15060 be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as rule
15061 is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.
15062 
15063 True, he replied.
15064 
15065 But I regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether the
15066 government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been
15067 trained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of
15068 the State will be maintained.
15069 
15070 That is true, he replied.
15071 
15072 
15073 
15074 
15075 BOOK V.
15076 
15077 Such is the good and true City or State, and the good and true man is
15078 of the same pattern; and if this is right every other is wrong; and the
15079 evil is one which affects not only the ordering of the State, but also
15080 the regulation of the individual soul, and is exhibited in four forms.
15081 
15082 What are they? he said.
15083 
15084 I was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared
15085 to me to succeed one another, when Polemarchus, who was sitting a little
15086 way off, just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to him: stretching
15087 forth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the
15088 shoulder, and drew him towards him, leaning forward himself so as to be
15089 quite close and saying something in his ear, of which I only caught the
15090 words, 'Shall we let him off, or what shall we do?'
15091 
15092 Certainly not, said Adeimantus, raising his voice.
15093 
15094 Who is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?
15095 
15096 You, he said.
15097 
15098 I repeated, Why am I especially not to be let off?
15099 
15100 Why, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a
15101 whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you fancy
15102 that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it were
15103 self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and children
15104 'friends have all things in common.'
15105 
15106 And was I not right, Adeimantus?
15107 
15108 Yes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like everything
15109 else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many kinds.
15110 Please, therefore, to say what sort of community you mean. We have been
15111 long expecting that you would tell us something about the family life
15112 of your citizens--how they will bring children into the world, and rear
15113 them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is the nature of this
15114 community of women and children--for we are of opinion that the right
15115 or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount
15116 influence on the State for good or for evil. And now, since the question
15117 is still undetermined, and you are taking in hand another State, we have
15118 resolved, as you heard, not to let you go until you give an account of
15119 all this.
15120 
15121 To that resolution, said Glaucon, you may regard me as saying Agreed.
15122 
15123 And without more ado, said Thrasymachus, you may consider us all to be
15124 equally agreed.
15125 
15126 I said, You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: What an
15127 argument are you raising about the State! Just as I thought that I had
15128 finished, and was only too glad that I had laid this question to sleep,
15129 and was reflecting how fortunate I was in your acceptance of what I then
15130 said, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation, ignorant of what
15131 a hornet's nest of words you are stirring. Now I foresaw this gathering
15132 trouble, and avoided it.
15133 
15134 For what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said
15135 Thrasymachus,--to look for gold, or to hear discourse?
15136 
15137 Yes, but discourse should have a limit.
15138 
15139 Yes, Socrates, said Glaucon, and the whole of life is the only limit
15140 which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. But never mind
15141 about us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way:
15142 What sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail
15143 among our guardians? and how shall we manage the period between birth
15144 and education, which seems to require the greatest care? Tell us how
15145 these things will be.
15146 
15147 Yes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many more
15148 doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions. For the
15149 practicability of what is said may be doubted; and looked at in another
15150 point of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable, would be for
15151 the best, is also doubtful. Hence I feel a reluctance to approach the
15152 subject, lest our aspiration, my dear friend, should turn out to be a
15153 dream only.
15154 
15155 Fear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you; they
15156 are not sceptical or hostile.
15157 
15158 I said: My good friend, I suppose that you mean to encourage me by these
15159 words.
15160 
15161 Yes, he said.
15162 
15163 Then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the
15164 encouragement which you offer would have been all very well had I myself
15165 believed that I knew what I was talking about: to declare the truth
15166 about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves among wise
15167 men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind; but to
15168 carry on an argument when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer,
15169 which is my condition, is a dangerous and slippery thing; and the danger
15170 is not that I shall be laughed at (of which the fear would be childish),
15171 but that I shall miss the truth where I have most need to be sure of my
15172 footing, and drag my friends after me in my fall. And I pray Nemesis not
15173 to visit upon me the words which I am going to utter. For I do indeed
15174 believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less crime than to be a
15175 deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in the matter of laws.
15176 And that is a risk which I would rather run among enemies than among
15177 friends, and therefore you do well to encourage me.
15178 
15179 Glaucon laughed and said: Well then, Socrates, in case you and your
15180 argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of
15181 the homicide, and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take courage then
15182 and speak.
15183 
15184 Well, I said, the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from
15185 guilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument.
15186 
15187 Then why should you mind?
15188 
15189 Well, I replied, I suppose that I must retrace my steps and say what I
15190 perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. The part of the
15191 men has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the
15192 women. Of them I will proceed to speak, and the more readily since I am
15193 invited by you.
15194 
15195 For men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my
15196 opinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and
15197 use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally
15198 started, when we said that the men were to be the guardians and
15199 watchdogs of the herd.
15200 
15201 True.
15202 
15203 Let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be
15204 subject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see
15205 whether the result accords with our design.
15206 
15207 What do you mean?
15208 
15209 What I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are dogs
15210 divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and
15211 in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to
15212 the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave
15213 the females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their
15214 puppies is labour enough for them?
15215 
15216 No, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is that
15217 the males are stronger and the females weaker.
15218 
15219 But can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they are
15220 bred and fed in the same way?
15221 
15222 You cannot.
15223 
15224 Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the
15225 same nurture and education?
15226 
15227 Yes.
15228 
15229 The education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic.
15230 
15231 Yes.
15232 
15233 Then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war,
15234 which they must practise like the men?
15235 
15236 That is the inference, I suppose.
15237 
15238 I should rather expect, I said, that several of our proposals, if they
15239 are carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.
15240 
15241 No doubt of it.
15242 
15243 Yes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women
15244 naked in the palaestra, exercising with the men, especially when they
15245 are no longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any
15246 more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness
15247 continue to frequent the gymnasia.
15248 
15249 Yes, indeed, he said: according to present notions the proposal would be
15250 thought ridiculous.
15251 
15252 But then, I said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we must not
15253 fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of
15254 innovation; how they will talk of women's attainments both in music
15255 and gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon
15256 horseback!
15257 
15258 Very true, he replied.
15259 
15260 Yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; at
15261 the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be
15262 serious. Not long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes were of the
15263 opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians, that
15264 the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when first the
15265 Cretans and then the Lacedaemonians introduced the custom, the wits of
15266 that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation.
15267 
15268 No doubt.
15269 
15270 But when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far
15271 better than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward
15272 eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then the
15273 man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule
15274 at any other sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously inclines to
15275 weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the good.
15276 
15277 Very true, he replied.
15278 
15279 First, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest,
15280 let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: Is she
15281 capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or
15282 not at all? And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or
15283 can not share? That will be the best way of commencing the enquiry, and
15284 will probably lead to the fairest conclusion.
15285 
15286 That will be much the best way.
15287 
15288 Shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against
15289 ourselves; in this manner the adversary's position will not be
15290 undefended.
15291 
15292 Why not? he said.
15293 
15294 Then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents. They will
15295 say: 'Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you
15296 yourselves, at the first foundation of the State, admitted the principle
15297 that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature.' And
15298 certainly, if I am not mistaken, such an admission was made by us. 'And
15299 do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?' And we
15300 shall reply: Of course they do. Then we shall be asked, 'Whether the
15301 tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different, and such as
15302 are agreeable to their different natures?' Certainly they should. 'But
15303 if so, have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that
15304 men and women, whose natures are so entirely different, ought to perform
15305 the same actions?'--What defence will you make for us, my good Sir,
15306 against any one who offers these objections?
15307 
15308 That is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I shall
15309 and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.
15310 
15311 These are the objections, Glaucon, and there are many others of a like
15312 kind, which I foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant to
15313 take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and
15314 children.
15315 
15316 By Zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but easy.
15317 
15318 Why yes, I said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth,
15319 whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean, he
15320 has to swim all the same.
15321 
15322 Very true.
15323 
15324 And must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that
15325 Arion's dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?
15326 
15327 I suppose so, he said.
15328 
15329 Well then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. We
15330 acknowledged--did we not? that different natures ought to have different
15331 pursuits, and that men's and women's natures are different. And now
15332 what are we saying?--that different natures ought to have the same
15333 pursuits,--this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us.
15334 
15335 Precisely.
15336 
15337 Verily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of
15338 contradiction!
15339 
15340 Why do you say so?
15341 
15342 Because I think that many a man falls into the practice against his
15343 will. When he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just
15344 because he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is
15345 speaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of
15346 contention and not of fair discussion.
15347 
15348 Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do
15349 with us and our argument?
15350 
15351 A great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting
15352 unintentionally into a verbal opposition.
15353 
15354 In what way?
15355 
15356 Why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that
15357 different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never
15358 considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of
15359 nature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits
15360 to different natures and the same to the same natures.
15361 
15362 Why, no, he said, that was never considered by us.
15363 
15364 I said: Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question
15365 whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy
15366 men; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers, we
15367 should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?
15368 
15369 That would be a jest, he said.
15370 
15371 Yes, I said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we constructed
15372 the State, that the opposition of natures should extend to every
15373 difference, but only to those differences which affected the pursuit
15374 in which the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for example,
15375 that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have
15376 the same nature.
15377 
15378 True.
15379 
15380 Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?
15381 
15382 Certainly.
15383 
15384 And if, I said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their
15385 fitness for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art
15386 ought to be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference
15387 consists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does not
15388 amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the
15389 sort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue
15390 to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same
15391 pursuits.
15392 
15393 Very true, he said.
15394 
15395 Next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits
15396 or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of a man?
15397 
15398 That will be quite fair.
15399 
15400 And perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient
15401 answer on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there
15402 is no difficulty.
15403 
15404 Yes, perhaps.
15405 
15406 Suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument, and
15407 then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the
15408 constitution of women which would affect them in the administration of
15409 the State.
15410 
15411 By all means.
15412 
15413 Let us say to him: Come now, and we will ask you a question:--when you
15414 spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean to
15415 say that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with difficulty; a
15416 little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas
15417 the other, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he
15418 forgets; or again, did you mean, that the one has a body which is a
15419 good servant to his mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to
15420 him?--would not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the
15421 man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted?
15422 
15423 No one will deny that.
15424 
15425 And can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not
15426 all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female? Need
15427 I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of
15428 pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be
15429 great, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the
15430 most absurd?
15431 
15432 You are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority
15433 of the female sex: although many women are in many things superior to
15434 many men, yet on the whole what you say is true.
15435 
15436 And if so, my friend, I said, there is no special faculty of
15437 administration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman, or
15438 which a man has by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike
15439 diffused in both; all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women
15440 also, but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man.
15441 
15442 Very true.
15443 
15444 Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on
15445 women?
15446 
15447 That will never do.
15448 
15449 One woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and
15450 another has no music in her nature?
15451 
15452 Very true.
15453 
15454 And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and
15455 another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?
15456 
15457 Certainly.
15458 
15459 And one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy;
15460 one has spirit, and another is without spirit?
15461 
15462 That is also true.
15463 
15464 Then one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not. Was
15465 not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of
15466 this sort?
15467 
15468 Yes.
15469 
15470 Men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they
15471 differ only in their comparative strength or weakness.
15472 
15473 Obviously.
15474 
15475 And those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the
15476 companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom
15477 they resemble in capacity and in character?
15478 
15479 Very true.
15480 
15481 And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?
15482 
15483 They ought.
15484 
15485 Then, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural in assigning
15486 music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians--to that point we come
15487 round again.
15488 
15489 Certainly not.
15490 
15491 The law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, and therefore not
15492 an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice, which
15493 prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.
15494 
15495 That appears to be true.
15496 
15497 We had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and
15498 secondly whether they were the most beneficial?
15499 
15500 Yes.
15501 
15502 And the possibility has been acknowledged?
15503 
15504 Yes.
15505 
15506 The very great benefit has next to be established?
15507 
15508 Quite so.
15509 
15510 You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian
15511 will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the
15512 same?
15513 
15514 Yes.
15515 
15516 I should like to ask you a question.
15517 
15518 What is it?
15519 
15520 Would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better
15521 than another?
15522 
15523 The latter.
15524 
15525 And in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the
15526 guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more
15527 perfect men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?
15528 
15529 What a ridiculous question!
15530 
15531 You have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not further say that
15532 our guardians are the best of our citizens?
15533 
15534 By far the best.
15535 
15536 And will not their wives be the best women?
15537 
15538 Yes, by far the best.
15539 
15540 And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than
15541 that the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?
15542 
15543 There can be nothing better.
15544 
15545 And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such
15546 manner as we have described, will accomplish?
15547 
15548 Certainly.
15549 
15550 Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest
15551 degree beneficial to the State?
15552 
15553 True.
15554 
15555 Then let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be
15556 their robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of
15557 their country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be
15558 assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other respects
15559 their duties are to be the same. And as for the man who laughs at naked
15560 women exercising their bodies from the best of motives, in his laughter
15561 he is plucking
15562 
15563 'A fruit of unripe wisdom,'
15564 
15565 and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at, or what he is
15566 about;--for that is, and ever will be, the best of sayings, That the
15567 useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base.
15568 
15569 Very true.
15570 
15571 Here, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may say
15572 that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for
15573 enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their
15574 pursuits in common; to the utility and also to the possibility of this
15575 arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.
15576 
15577 Yes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.
15578 
15579 Yes, I said, but a greater is coming; you will not think much of this
15580 when you see the next.
15581 
15582 Go on; let me see.
15583 
15584 The law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has
15585 preceded, is to the following effect,--'that the wives of our guardians
15586 are to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is
15587 to know his own child, nor any child his parent.'
15588 
15589 Yes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and
15590 the possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more
15591 questionable.
15592 
15593 I do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the very
15594 great utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility is
15595 quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.
15596 
15597 I think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.
15598 
15599 You imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied. Now I
15600 meant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as I thought,
15601 I should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only the
15602 possibility.
15603 
15604 But that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please to
15605 give a defence of both.
15606 
15607 Well, I said, I submit to my fate. Yet grant me a little favour: let
15608 me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of
15609 feasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have
15610 discovered any means of effecting their wishes--that is a matter which
15611 never troubles them--they would rather not tire themselves by thinking
15612 about possibilities; but assuming that what they desire is already
15613 granted to them, they proceed with their plan, and delight in detailing
15614 what they mean to do when their wish has come true--that is a way which
15615 they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for
15616 much. Now I myself am beginning to lose heart, and I should like, with
15617 your permission, to pass over the question of possibility at present.
15618 Assuming therefore the possibility of the proposal, I shall now proceed
15619 to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and I shall
15620 demonstrate that our plan, if executed, will be of the greatest benefit
15621 to the State and to the guardians. First of all, then, if you have no
15622 objection, I will endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of
15623 the measure; and hereafter the question of possibility.
15624 
15625 I have no objection; proceed.
15626 
15627 First, I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy
15628 of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey in the
15629 one and the power of command in the other; the guardians must themselves
15630 obey the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any
15631 details which are entrusted to their care.
15632 
15633 That is right, he said.
15634 
15635 You, I said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will now
15636 select the women and give them to them;--they must be as far as possible
15637 of like natures with them; and they must live in common houses and meet
15638 at common meals. None of them will have anything specially his or her
15639 own; they will be together, and will be brought up together, and
15640 will associate at gymnastic exercises. And so they will be drawn by
15641 a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each
15642 other--necessity is not too strong a word, I think?
15643 
15644 Yes, he said;--necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of necessity
15645 which lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining to
15646 the mass of mankind.
15647 
15648 True, I said; and this, Glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed after
15649 an orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, licentiousness is an
15650 unholy thing which the rulers will forbid.
15651 
15652 Yes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted.
15653 
15654 Then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the
15655 highest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?
15656 
15657 Exactly.
15658 
15659 And how can marriages be made most beneficial?--that is a question which
15660 I put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and of the
15661 nobler sort of birds not a few. Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you
15662 ever attended to their pairing and breeding?
15663 
15664 In what particulars?
15665 
15666 Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not
15667 some better than others?
15668 
15669 True.
15670 
15671 And do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to
15672 breed from the best only?
15673 
15674 From the best.
15675 
15676 And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?
15677 
15678 I choose only those of ripe age.
15679 
15680 And if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would
15681 greatly deteriorate?
15682 
15683 Certainly.
15684 
15685 And the same of horses and animals in general?
15686 
15687 Undoubtedly.
15688 
15689 Good heavens! my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will our
15690 rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!
15691 
15692 Certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any
15693 particular skill?
15694 
15695 Because, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body
15696 corporate with medicines. Now you know that when patients do not require
15697 medicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the inferior sort
15698 of practitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when medicine has to be
15699 given, then the doctor should be more of a man.
15700 
15701 That is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?
15702 
15703 I mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of
15704 falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we were
15705 saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be
15706 of advantage.
15707 
15708 And we were very right.
15709 
15710 And this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the
15711 regulations of marriages and births.
15712 
15713 How so?
15714 
15715 Why, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of
15716 either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior
15717 with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the
15718 offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock
15719 is to be maintained in first-rate condition. Now these goings on must be
15720 a secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a further
15721 danger of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking out into
15722 rebellion.
15723 
15724 Very true.
15725 
15726 Had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring
15727 together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and
15728 suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is
15729 a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim
15730 will be to preserve the average of population? There are many other
15731 things which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars and
15732 diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is possible
15733 to prevent the State from becoming either too large or too small.
15734 
15735 Certainly, he replied.
15736 
15737 We shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less
15738 worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and then
15739 they will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.
15740 
15741 To be sure, he said.
15742 
15743 And I think that our braver and better youth, besides their other
15744 honours and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with
15745 women given them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers ought
15746 to have as many sons as possible.
15747 
15748 True.
15749 
15750 And the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices are
15751 to be held by women as well as by men--
15752 
15753 Yes--
15754 
15755 The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the
15756 pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who
15757 dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of
15758 the better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some
15759 mysterious, unknown place, as they should be.
15760 
15761 Yes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be
15762 kept pure.
15763 
15764 They will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to the
15765 fold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible care that
15766 no mother recognises her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged
15767 if more are required. Care will also be taken that the process of
15768 suckling shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers will have no
15769 getting up at night or other trouble, but will hand over all this sort
15770 of thing to the nurses and attendants.
15771 
15772 You suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it
15773 when they are having children.
15774 
15775 Why, said I, and so they ought. Let us, however, proceed with our
15776 scheme. We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?
15777 
15778 Very true.
15779 
15780 And what is the prime of life? May it not be defined as a period of
15781 about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?
15782 
15783 Which years do you mean to include?
15784 
15785 A woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to
15786 the State, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at
15787 five-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life
15788 beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be fifty-five.
15789 
15790 Certainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the prime of
15791 physical as well as of intellectual vigour.
15792 
15793 Any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public
15794 hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing;
15795 the child of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will have
15796 been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers,
15797 which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will
15798 offer, that the new generation may be better and more useful than their
15799 good and useful parents, whereas his child will be the offspring of
15800 darkness and strange lust.
15801 
15802 Very true, he replied.
15803 
15804 And the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed
15805 age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without
15806 the sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a
15807 bastard to the State, uncertified and unconsecrated.
15808 
15809 Very true, he replied.
15810 
15811 This applies, however, only to those who are within the specified age:
15812 after that we allow them to range at will, except that a man may not
15813 marry his daughter or his daughter's daughter, or his mother or his
15814 mother's mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from
15815 marrying their sons or fathers, or son's son or father's father, and
15816 so on in either direction. And we grant all this, accompanying the
15817 permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into
15818 being from seeing the light; and if any force a way to the birth, the
15819 parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be
15820 maintained, and arrange accordingly.
15821 
15822 That also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. But how will they know
15823 who are fathers and daughters, and so on?
15824 
15825 They will never know. The way will be this:--dating from the day of the
15826 hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male
15827 children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his
15828 sons, and the female children his daughters, and they will call him
15829 father, and he will call their children his grandchildren, and they will
15830 call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers. All who were
15831 begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together will
15832 be called their brothers and sisters, and these, as I was saying, will
15833 be forbidden to inter-marry. This, however, is not to be understood as
15834 an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters; if the
15835 lot favours them, and they receive the sanction of the Pythian oracle,
15836 the law will allow them.
15837 
15838 Quite right, he replied.
15839 
15840 Such is the scheme, Glaucon, according to which the guardians of our
15841 State are to have their wives and families in common. And now you would
15842 have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest
15843 of our polity, and also that nothing can be better--would you not?
15844 
15845 Yes, certainly.
15846 
15847 Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought
15848 to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the
15849 organization of a State,--what is the greatest good, and what is the
15850 greatest evil, and then consider whether our previous description has
15851 the stamp of the good or of the evil?
15852 
15853 By all means.
15854 
15855 Can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality
15856 where unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond of unity?
15857 
15858 There cannot.
15859 
15860 And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and
15861 pains--where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions
15862 of joy and sorrow?
15863 
15864 No doubt.
15865 
15866 Yes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State is
15867 disorganized--when you have one half of the world triumphing and the
15868 other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the
15869 citizens?
15870 
15871 Certainly.
15872 
15873 Such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of
15874 the terms 'mine' and 'not mine,' 'his' and 'not his.'
15875 
15876 Exactly so.
15877 
15878 And is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest number of
15879 persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to the
15880 same thing?
15881 
15882 Quite true.
15883 
15884 Or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the
15885 individual--as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt, the
15886 whole frame, drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one kingdom
15887 under the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all
15888 together with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in
15889 his finger; and the same expression is used about any other part of the
15890 body, which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the
15891 alleviation of suffering.
15892 
15893 Very true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the best-ordered
15894 State there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you
15895 describe.
15896 
15897 Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the
15898 whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or
15899 sorrow with him?
15900 
15901 Yes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered State.
15902 
15903 It will now be time, I said, for us to return to our State and see
15904 whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these
15905 fundamental principles.
15906 
15907 Very good.
15908 
15909 Our State like every other has rulers and subjects?
15910 
15911 True.
15912 
15913 All of whom will call one another citizens?
15914 
15915 Of course.
15916 
15917 But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other
15918 States?
15919 
15920 Generally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply
15921 call them rulers.
15922 
15923 And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people
15924 give the rulers?
15925 
15926 They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.
15927 
15928 And what do the rulers call the people?
15929 
15930 Their maintainers and foster-fathers.
15931 
15932 And what do they call them in other States?
15933 
15934 Slaves.
15935 
15936 And what do the rulers call one another in other States?
15937 
15938 Fellow-rulers.
15939 
15940 And what in ours?
15941 
15942 Fellow-guardians.
15943 
15944 Did you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would
15945 speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being
15946 his friend?
15947 
15948 Yes, very often.
15949 
15950 And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an
15951 interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?
15952 
15953 Exactly.
15954 
15955 But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as
15956 a stranger?
15957 
15958 Certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded
15959 by them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or
15960 daughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with
15961 him.
15962 
15963 Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a family in
15964 name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name? For
15965 example, in the use of the word 'father,' would the care of a father be
15966 implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the
15967 law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an
15968 impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good
15969 either at the hands of God or of man? Are these to be or not to be the
15970 strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the
15971 citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and
15972 the rest of their kinsfolk?
15973 
15974 These, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than for
15975 them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act
15976 in the spirit of them?
15977 
15978 Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often
15979 heard than in any other. As I was describing before, when any one is
15980 well or ill, the universal word will be 'with me it is well' or 'it is
15981 ill.'
15982 
15983 Most true.
15984 
15985 And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying
15986 that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?
15987 
15988 Yes, and so they will.
15989 
15990 And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will
15991 alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a
15992 common feeling of pleasure and pain?
15993 
15994 Yes, far more so than in other States.
15995 
15996 And the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the
15997 State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and
15998 children?
15999 
16000 That will be the chief reason.
16001 
16002 And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was
16003 implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation of
16004 the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?
16005 
16006 That we acknowledged, and very rightly.
16007 
16008 Then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly
16009 the source of the greatest good to the State?
16010 
16011 Certainly.
16012 
16013 And this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming,--that
16014 the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property;
16015 their pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the
16016 other citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we
16017 intended them to preserve their true character of guardians.
16018 
16019 Right, he replied.
16020 
16021 Both the community of property and the community of families, as I am
16022 saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear
16023 the city in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each man
16024 dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his
16025 own, where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and
16026 pains; but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures
16027 and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and
16028 dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards a common end.
16029 
16030 Certainly, he replied.
16031 
16032 And as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their
16033 own, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will
16034 be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or
16035 relations are the occasion.
16036 
16037 Of course they will.
16038 
16039 Neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among
16040 them. For that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall
16041 maintain to be honourable and right; we shall make the protection of the
16042 person a matter of necessity.
16043 
16044 That is good, he said.
16045 
16046 Yes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has a
16047 quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and
16048 not proceed to more dangerous lengths.
16049 
16050 Certainly.
16051 
16052 To the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the
16053 younger.
16054 
16055 Clearly.
16056 
16057 Nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any
16058 other violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor will
16059 he slight him in any way. For there are two guardians, shame and fear,
16060 mighty to prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from laying hands
16061 on those who are to them in the relation of parents; fear, that the
16062 injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers, sons,
16063 fathers.
16064 
16065 That is true, he replied.
16066 
16067 Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with
16068 one another?
16069 
16070 Yes, there will be no want of peace.
16071 
16072 And as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be
16073 no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or
16074 against one another.
16075 
16076 None whatever.
16077 
16078 I hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will
16079 be rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for example, as the
16080 flattery of the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which
16081 men experience in bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy
16082 necessaries for their household, borrowing and then repudiating, getting
16083 how they can, and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves
16084 to keep--the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this way
16085 are mean enough and obvious enough, and not worth speaking of.
16086 
16087 Yes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that.
16088 
16089 And from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life will be
16090 blessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more blessed.
16091 
16092 How so?
16093 
16094 The Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only of
16095 the blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more
16096 glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public
16097 cost. For the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole
16098 State; and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is
16099 the fulness of all that life needs; they receive rewards from the
16100 hands of their country while living, and after death have an honourable
16101 burial.
16102 
16103 Yes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.
16104 
16105 Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion
16106 some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians
16107 unhappy--they had nothing and might have possessed all things--to whom
16108 we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter
16109 consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make
16110 our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State
16111 with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but
16112 of the whole?
16113 
16114 Yes, I remember.
16115 
16116 And what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to
16117 be far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors--is the life of
16118 shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared with
16119 it?
16120 
16121 Certainly not.
16122 
16123 At the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere, that
16124 if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that
16125 he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe and
16126 harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best, but
16127 infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his
16128 head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself, then he will
16129 have to learn how wisely Hesiod spoke, when he said, 'half is more than
16130 the whole.'
16131 
16132 If he were to consult me, I should say to him: Stay where you are, when
16133 you have the offer of such a life.
16134 
16135 You agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common way of
16136 life such as we have described--common education, common children; and
16137 they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the
16138 city or going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt
16139 together like dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are
16140 able, women are to share with the men? And in so doing they will do what
16141 is best, and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation of the
16142 sexes.
16143 
16144 I agree with you, he replied.
16145 
16146 The enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community
16147 be found possible--as among other animals, so also among men--and if
16148 possible, in what way possible?
16149 
16150 You have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest.
16151 
16152 There is no difficulty, I said, in seeing how war will be carried on by
16153 them.
16154 
16155 How?
16156 
16157 Why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take with
16158 them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the manner
16159 of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will
16160 have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will
16161 have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and
16162 mothers. Did you never observe in the arts how the potters' boys look on
16163 and help, long before they touch the wheel?
16164 
16165 Yes, I have.
16166 
16167 And shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in
16168 giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than
16169 our guardians will be?
16170 
16171 The idea is ridiculous, he said.
16172 
16173 There is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other
16174 animals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive
16175 to valour.
16176 
16177 That is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which may
16178 often happen in war, how great the danger is! the children will be lost
16179 as well as their parents, and the State will never recover.
16180 
16181 True, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?
16182 
16183 I am far from saying that.
16184 
16185 Well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some
16186 occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?
16187 
16188 Clearly.
16189 
16190 Whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their
16191 youth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk may
16192 fairly be incurred.
16193 
16194 Yes, very important.
16195 
16196 This then must be our first step,--to make our children spectators
16197 of war; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against
16198 danger; then all will be well.
16199 
16200 True.
16201 
16202 Their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war, but
16203 to know, as far as human foresight can, what expeditions are safe and
16204 what dangerous?
16205 
16206 That may be assumed.
16207 
16208 And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about
16209 the dangerous ones?
16210 
16211 True.
16212 
16213 And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who
16214 will be their leaders and teachers?
16215 
16216 Very properly.
16217 
16218 Still, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good
16219 deal of chance about them?
16220 
16221 True.
16222 
16223 Then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with
16224 wings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.
16225 
16226 What do you mean? he said.
16227 
16228 I mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth, and
16229 when they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war: the
16230 horses must not be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and yet
16231 the swiftest that can be had. In this way they will get an excellent
16232 view of what is hereafter to be their own business; and if there is
16233 danger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape.
16234 
16235 I believe that you are right, he said.
16236 
16237 Next, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one
16238 another and to their enemies? I should be inclined to propose that the
16239 soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of any
16240 other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman
16241 or artisan. What do you think?
16242 
16243 By all means, I should say.
16244 
16245 And he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a
16246 present of to his enemies; he is their lawful prey, and let them do what
16247 they like with him.
16248 
16249 Certainly.
16250 
16251 But the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to
16252 him? In the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from his
16253 youthful comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown him. What
16254 do you say?
16255 
16256 I approve.
16257 
16258 And what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship?
16259 
16260 To that too, I agree.
16261 
16262 But you will hardly agree to my next proposal.
16263 
16264 What is your proposal?
16265 
16266 That he should kiss and be kissed by them.
16267 
16268 Most certainly, and I should be disposed to go further, and say: Let
16269 no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the
16270 expedition lasts. So that if there be a lover in the army, whether
16271 his love be youth or maiden, he may be more eager to win the prize of
16272 valour.
16273 
16274 Capital, I said. That the brave man is to have more wives than others
16275 has been already determined: and he is to have first choices in such
16276 matters more than others, in order that he may have as many children as
16277 possible?
16278 
16279 Agreed.
16280 
16281 Again, there is another manner in which, according to Homer, brave
16282 youths should be honoured; for he tells how Ajax, after he had
16283 distinguished himself in battle, was rewarded with long chines, which
16284 seems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age,
16285 being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing.
16286 
16287 Most true, he said.
16288 
16289 Then in this, I said, Homer shall be our teacher; and we too, at
16290 sacrifices and on the like occasions, will honour the brave according to
16291 the measure of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and those
16292 other distinctions which we were mentioning; also with
16293 
16294 'seats of precedence, and meats and full cups;'
16295 
16296 and in honouring them, we shall be at the same time training them.
16297 
16298 That, he replied, is excellent.
16299 
16300 Yes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in
16301 the first place, that he is of the golden race?
16302 
16303 To be sure.
16304 
16305 Nay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they
16306 are dead
16307 
16308 'They are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of evil,
16309 the guardians of speech-gifted men'?
16310 
16311 Yes; and we accept his authority.
16312 
16313 We must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and
16314 heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction; and we
16315 must do as he bids?
16316 
16317 By all means.
16318 
16319 And in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their
16320 sepulchres as at the graves of heroes. And not only they but any who are
16321 deemed pre-eminently good, whether they die from age, or in any other
16322 way, shall be admitted to the same honours.
16323 
16324 That is very right, he said.
16325 
16326 Next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies? What about this?
16327 
16328 In what respect do you mean?
16329 
16330 First of all, in regard to slavery? Do you think it right that Hellenes
16331 should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if
16332 they can help? Should not their custom be to spare them, considering
16333 the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the
16334 yoke of the barbarians?
16335 
16336 To spare them is infinitely better.
16337 
16338 Then no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule which
16339 they will observe and advise the other Hellenes to observe.
16340 
16341 Certainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the
16342 barbarians and will keep their hands off one another.
16343 
16344 Next as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take anything
16345 but their armour? Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford
16346 an excuse for not facing the battle? Cowards skulk about the dead,
16347 pretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now
16348 has been lost from this love of plunder.
16349 
16350 Very true.
16351 
16352 And is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and also
16353 a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead
16354 body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting
16355 gear behind him,--is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his
16356 assailant, quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?
16357 
16358 Very like a dog, he said.
16359 
16360 Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?
16361 
16362 Yes, he replied, we most certainly must.
16363 
16364 Neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of all
16365 the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other
16366 Hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of
16367 spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god
16368 himself?
16369 
16370 Very true.
16371 
16372 Again, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning of
16373 houses, what is to be the practice?
16374 
16375 May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?
16376 
16377 Both should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take the annual
16378 produce and no more. Shall I tell you why?
16379 
16380 Pray do.
16381 
16382 Why, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,'
16383 and I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one
16384 is expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is
16385 external and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and
16386 only the second, war.
16387 
16388 That is a very proper distinction, he replied.
16389 
16390 And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race is all
16391 united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and strange
16392 to the barbarians?
16393 
16394 Very good, he said.
16395 
16396 And therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with
16397 Hellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight,
16398 and by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called war;
16399 but when Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas is
16400 then in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature friends;
16401 and such enmity is to be called discord.
16402 
16403 I agree.
16404 
16405 Consider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be
16406 discord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the lands
16407 and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife appear!
16408 No true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his
16409 own nurse and mother: There might be reason in the conqueror depriving
16410 the conquered of their harvest, but still they would have the idea of
16411 peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever.
16412 
16413 Yes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.
16414 
16415 And will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic city?
16416 
16417 It ought to be, he replied.
16418 
16419 Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?
16420 
16421 Yes, very civilized.
16422 
16423 And will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their own
16424 land, and share in the common temples?
16425 
16426 Most certainly.
16427 
16428 And any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as
16429 discord only--a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a war?
16430 
16431 Certainly not.
16432 
16433 Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?
16434 
16435 Certainly.
16436 
16437 They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy their
16438 opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?
16439 
16440 Just so.
16441 
16442 And as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate Hellas, nor
16443 will they burn houses, nor ever suppose that the whole population of a
16444 city--men, women, and children--are equally their enemies, for they know
16445 that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the
16446 many are their friends. And for all these reasons they will be unwilling
16447 to waste their lands and rase their houses; their enmity to them will
16448 only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty
16449 few to give satisfaction?
16450 
16451 I agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their Hellenic
16452 enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one another.
16453 
16454 Then let us enact this law also for our guardians:--that they are
16455 neither to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their houses.
16456 
16457 Agreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, like all our
16458 previous enactments, are very good.
16459 
16460 But still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in
16461 this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the
16462 commencement of this discussion you thrust aside:--Is such an order of
16463 things possible, and how, if at all? For I am quite ready to acknowledge
16464 that the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts of
16465 good to the State. I will add, what you have omitted, that your citizens
16466 will be the bravest of warriors, and will never leave their ranks, for
16467 they will all know one another, and each will call the other father,
16468 brother, son; and if you suppose the women to join their armies, whether
16469 in the same rank or in the rear, either as a terror to the enemy, or as
16470 auxiliaries in case of need, I know that they will then be absolutely
16471 invincible; and there are many domestic advantages which might also be
16472 mentioned and which I also fully acknowledge: but, as I admit all these
16473 advantages and as many more as you please, if only this State of yours
16474 were to come into existence, we need say no more about them; assuming
16475 then the existence of the State, let us now turn to the question of
16476 possibility and ways and means--the rest may be left.
16477 
16478 If I loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, I said, and
16479 have no mercy; I have hardly escaped the first and second waves, and you
16480 seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third, which
16481 is the greatest and heaviest. When you have seen and heard the third
16482 wave, I think you will be more considerate and will acknowledge
16483 that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so
16484 extraordinary as that which I have now to state and investigate.
16485 
16486 The more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more
16487 determined are we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible:
16488 speak out and at once.
16489 
16490 Let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search
16491 after justice and injustice.
16492 
16493 True, he replied; but what of that?
16494 
16495 I was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to
16496 require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice; or
16497 may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in him of
16498 a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?
16499 
16500 The approximation will be enough.
16501 
16502 We were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the
16503 character of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly
16504 unjust, that we might have an ideal. We were to look at these in order
16505 that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to
16506 the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled
16507 them, but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact.
16508 
16509 True, he said.
16510 
16511 Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with
16512 consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to
16513 show that any such man could ever have existed?
16514 
16515 He would be none the worse.
16516 
16517 Well, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State?
16518 
16519 To be sure.
16520 
16521 And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the
16522 possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?
16523 
16524 Surely not, he replied.
16525 
16526 That is the truth, I said. But if, at your request, I am to try and show
16527 how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, I must ask
16528 you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.
16529 
16530 What admissions?
16531 
16532 I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language?
16533 Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual,
16534 whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of
16535 the truth? What do you say?
16536 
16537 I agree.
16538 
16539 Then you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will in
16540 every respect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover
16541 how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that we
16542 have discovered the possibility which you demand; and will be contented.
16543 I am sure that I should be contented--will not you?
16544 
16545 Yes, I will.
16546 
16547 Let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in States which is the
16548 cause of their present maladministration, and what is the least change
16549 which will enable a State to pass into the truer form; and let the
16550 change, if possible, be of one thing only, or, if not, of two; at any
16551 rate, let the changes be as few and slight as possible.
16552 
16553 Certainly, he replied.
16554 
16555 I think, I said, that there might be a reform of the State if only one
16556 change were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible
16557 one.
16558 
16559 What is it? he said.
16560 
16561 Now then, I said, I go to meet that which I liken to the greatest of
16562 the waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break and
16563 drown me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.
16564 
16565 Proceed.
16566 
16567 I said: 'Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this
16568 world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness
16569 and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either
16570 to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities
16571 will never have rest from their evils,--nor the human race, as I
16572 believe,--and then only will this our State have a possibility of life
16573 and behold the light of day.' Such was the thought, my dear Glaucon,
16574 which I would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant;
16575 for to be convinced that in no other State can there be happiness
16576 private or public is indeed a hard thing.
16577 
16578 Socrates, what do you mean? I would have you consider that the word
16579 which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very
16580 respectable persons too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in a
16581 moment, and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you might
16582 and main, before you know where you are, intending to do heaven knows
16583 what; and if you don't prepare an answer, and put yourself in motion,
16584 you will be 'pared by their fine wits,' and no mistake.
16585 
16586 You got me into the scrape, I said.
16587 
16588 And I was quite right; however, I will do all I can to get you out of
16589 it; but I can only give you good-will and good advice, and, perhaps, I
16590 may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another--that
16591 is all. And now, having such an auxiliary, you must do your best to show
16592 the unbelievers that you are right.
16593 
16594 I ought to try, I said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance.
16595 And I think that, if there is to be a chance of our escaping, we must
16596 explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule
16597 in the State; then we shall be able to defend ourselves: There will be
16598 discovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be
16599 leaders in the State; and others who are not born to be philosophers,
16600 and are meant to be followers rather than leaders.
16601 
16602 Then now for a definition, he said.
16603 
16604 Follow me, I said, and I hope that I may in some way or other be able to
16605 give you a satisfactory explanation.
16606 
16607 Proceed.
16608 
16609 I dare say that you remember, and therefore I need not remind you, that
16610 a lover, if he is worthy of the name, ought to show his love, not to
16611 some one part of that which he loves, but to the whole.
16612 
16613 I really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist my
16614 memory.
16615 
16616 Another person, I said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man of
16617 pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of
16618 youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover's breast,
16619 and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards. Is not
16620 this a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you
16621 praise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a
16622 royal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of
16623 regularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the gods;
16624 and as to the sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called, what is the very
16625 name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is not
16626 averse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth? In a word, there
16627 is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will not
16628 say, in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the spring-time
16629 of youth.
16630 
16631 If you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of the
16632 argument, I assent.
16633 
16634 And what do you say of lovers of wine? Do you not see them doing the
16635 same? They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.
16636 
16637 Very good.
16638 
16639 And the same is true of ambitious men; if they cannot command an army,
16640 they are willing to command a file; and if they cannot be honoured by
16641 really great and important persons, they are glad to be honoured by
16642 lesser and meaner people,--but honour of some kind they must have.
16643 
16644 Exactly.
16645 
16646 Once more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, desire the
16647 whole class or a part only?
16648 
16649 The whole.
16650 
16651 And may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a part
16652 of wisdom only, but of the whole?
16653 
16654 Yes, of the whole.
16655 
16656 And he who dislikes learning, especially in youth, when he has no power
16657 of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not
16658 to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his
16659 food is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a
16660 good one?
16661 
16662 Very true, he said.
16663 
16664 Whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is
16665 curious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a
16666 philosopher? Am I not right?
16667 
16668 Glaucon said: If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many a
16669 strange being will have a title to the name. All the lovers of sights
16670 have a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. Musical
16671 amateurs, too, are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers, for
16672 they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything like
16673 a philosophical discussion, if they could help, while they run about at
16674 the Dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to hear every
16675 chorus; whether the performance is in town or country--that makes no
16676 difference--they are there. Now are we to maintain that all these and
16677 any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors of quite minor
16678 arts, are philosophers?
16679 
16680 Certainly not, I replied; they are only an imitation.
16681 
16682 He said: Who then are the true philosophers?
16683 
16684 Those, I said, who are lovers of the vision of truth.
16685 
16686 That is also good, he said; but I should like to know what you mean?
16687 
16688 To another, I replied, I might have a difficulty in explaining; but I am
16689 sure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to make.
16690 
16691 What is the proposition?
16692 
16693 That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?
16694 
16695 Certainly.
16696 
16697 And inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?
16698 
16699 True again.
16700 
16701 And of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the
16702 same remark holds: taken singly, each of them is one; but from the
16703 various combinations of them with actions and things and with one
16704 another, they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?
16705 
16706 Very true.
16707 
16708 And this is the distinction which I draw between the sight-loving,
16709 art-loving, practical class and those of whom I am speaking, and who are
16710 alone worthy of the name of philosophers.
16711 
16712 How do you distinguish them? he said.
16713 
16714 The lovers of sounds and sights, I replied, are, as I conceive, fond of
16715 fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that
16716 are made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving
16717 absolute beauty.
16718 
16719 True, he replied.
16720 
16721 Few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.
16722 
16723 Very true.
16724 
16725 And he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute
16726 beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is
16727 unable to follow--of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream
16728 only? Reflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens
16729 dissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?
16730 
16731 I should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.
16732 
16733 But take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of absolute
16734 beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which
16735 participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the
16736 idea nor the idea in the place of the objects--is he a dreamer, or is he
16737 awake?
16738 
16739 He is wide awake.
16740 
16741 And may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge, and
16742 that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion?
16743 
16744 Certainly.
16745 
16746 But suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our
16747 statement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him,
16748 without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?
16749 
16750 We must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.
16751 
16752 Come, then, and let us think of something to say to him. Shall we begin
16753 by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have,
16754 and that we are rejoiced at his having it? But we should like to ask him
16755 a question: Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing? (You
16756 must answer for him.)
16757 
16758 I answer that he knows something.
16759 
16760 Something that is or is not?
16761 
16762 Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?
16763 
16764 And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of
16765 view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the
16766 utterly non-existent is utterly unknown?
16767 
16768 Nothing can be more certain.
16769 
16770 Good. But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and
16771 not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and
16772 the absolute negation of being?
16773 
16774 Yes, between them.
16775 
16776 And, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to
16777 not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has
16778 to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and
16779 knowledge, if there be such?
16780 
16781 Certainly.
16782 
16783 Do we admit the existence of opinion?
16784 
16785 Undoubtedly.
16786 
16787 As being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?
16788 
16789 Another faculty.
16790 
16791 Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter
16792 corresponding to this difference of faculties?
16793 
16794 Yes.
16795 
16796 And knowledge is relative to being and knows being. But before I proceed
16797 further I will make a division.
16798 
16799 What division?
16800 
16801 I will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are
16802 powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. Sight
16803 and hearing, for example, I should call faculties. Have I clearly
16804 explained the class which I mean?
16805 
16806 Yes, I quite understand.
16807 
16808 Then let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and
16809 therefore the distinctions of figure, colour, and the like, which enable
16810 me to discern the differences of some things, do not apply to them. In
16811 speaking of a faculty I think only of its sphere and its result; and
16812 that which has the same sphere and the same result I call the same
16813 faculty, but that which has another sphere and another result I call
16814 different. Would that be your way of speaking?
16815 
16816 Yes.
16817 
16818 And will you be so very good as to answer one more question? Would you
16819 say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?
16820 
16821 Certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.
16822 
16823 And is opinion also a faculty?
16824 
16825 Certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form
16826 an opinion.
16827 
16828 And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not
16829 the same as opinion?
16830 
16831 Why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which
16832 is infallible with that which errs?
16833 
16834 An excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious of a
16835 distinction between them.
16836 
16837 Yes.
16838 
16839 Then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct
16840 spheres or subject-matters?
16841 
16842 That is certain.
16843 
16844 Being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to
16845 know the nature of being?
16846 
16847 Yes.
16848 
16849 And opinion is to have an opinion?
16850 
16851 Yes.
16852 
16853 And do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion the
16854 same as the subject-matter of knowledge?
16855 
16856 Nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in
16857 faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject-matter, and if, as
16858 we were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the
16859 sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.
16860 
16861 Then if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must be
16862 the subject-matter of opinion?
16863 
16864 Yes, something else.
16865 
16866 Well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, how
16867 can there be an opinion at all about not-being? Reflect: when a man
16868 has an opinion, has he not an opinion about something? Can he have an
16869 opinion which is an opinion about nothing?
16870 
16871 Impossible.
16872 
16873 He who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?
16874 
16875 Yes.
16876 
16877 And not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?
16878 
16879 True.
16880 
16881 Of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of
16882 being, knowledge?
16883 
16884 True, he said.
16885 
16886 Then opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?
16887 
16888 Not with either.
16889 
16890 And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?
16891 
16892 That seems to be true.
16893 
16894 But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in
16895 a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than
16896 ignorance?
16897 
16898 In neither.
16899 
16900 Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,
16901 but lighter than ignorance?
16902 
16903 Both; and in no small degree.
16904 
16905 And also to be within and between them?
16906 
16907 Yes.
16908 
16909 Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?
16910 
16911 No question.
16912 
16913 But were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a sort
16914 which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would appear
16915 also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being;
16916 and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance,
16917 but will be found in the interval between them?
16918 
16919 True.
16920 
16921 And in that interval there has now been discovered something which we
16922 call opinion?
16923 
16924 There has.
16925 
16926 Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally
16927 of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed
16928 either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may
16929 truly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper
16930 faculty,--the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to
16931 the faculty of the mean.
16932 
16933 True.
16934 
16935 This being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that
16936 there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty--in whose opinion
16937 the beautiful is the manifold--he, I say, your lover of beautiful
16938 sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the
16939 just is one, or that anything is one--to him I would appeal, saying,
16940 Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these
16941 beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the
16942 just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not
16943 also be unholy?
16944 
16945 No, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly;
16946 and the same is true of the rest.
16947 
16948 And may not the many which are doubles be also halves?--doubles, that
16949 is, of one thing, and halves of another?
16950 
16951 Quite true.
16952 
16953 And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will
16954 not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?
16955 
16956 True; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of
16957 them.
16958 
16959 And can any one of those many things which are called by particular
16960 names be said to be this rather than not to be this?
16961 
16962 He replied: They are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts
16963 or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with
16964 what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat
16965 was sitting. The individual objects of which I am speaking are also
16966 a riddle, and have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind,
16967 either as being or not-being, or both, or neither.
16968 
16969 Then what will you do with them? I said. Can they have a better place
16970 than between being and not-being? For they are clearly not in greater
16971 darkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and existence
16972 than being.
16973 
16974 That is quite true, he said.
16975 
16976 Thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the
16977 multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are
16978 tossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and
16979 pure not-being?
16980 
16981 We have.
16982 
16983 Yes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might
16984 find was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter of
16985 knowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by
16986 the intermediate faculty.
16987 
16988 Quite true.
16989 
16990 Then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute
16991 beauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see the
16992 many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,--such persons may be
16993 said to have opinion but not knowledge?
16994 
16995 That is certain.
16996 
16997 But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to
16998 know, and not to have opinion only?
16999 
17000 Neither can that be denied.
17001 
17002 The one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge, the other those of
17003 opinion? The latter are the same, as I dare say you will remember, who
17004 listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not
17005 tolerate the existence of absolute beauty.
17006 
17007 Yes, I remember.
17008 
17009 Shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of
17010 opinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with
17011 us for thus describing them?
17012 
17013 I shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what is
17014 true.
17015 
17016 But those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of
17017 wisdom and not lovers of opinion.
17018 
17019 Assuredly.
17020 
17021 
17022 
17023 
17024 BOOK VI.
17025 
17026 And thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true and
17027 the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.
17028 
17029 I do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.
17030 
17031 I suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a better
17032 view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this
17033 one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us,
17034 which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs
17035 from that of the unjust must consider.
17036 
17037 And what is the next question? he asked.
17038 
17039 Surely, I said, the one which follows next in order. Inasmuch as
17040 philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable,
17041 and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not
17042 philosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the
17043 rulers of our State?
17044 
17045 And how can we rightly answer that question?
17046 
17047 Whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of
17048 our State--let them be our guardians.
17049 
17050 Very good.
17051 
17052 Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to
17053 keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?
17054 
17055 There can be no question of that.
17056 
17057 And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge
17058 of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear
17059 pattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute
17060 truth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the
17061 other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this,
17062 if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them--are
17063 not such persons, I ask, simply blind?
17064 
17065 Truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.
17066 
17067 And shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides being
17068 their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of
17069 virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?
17070 
17071 There can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this
17072 greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place
17073 unless they fail in some other respect.
17074 
17075 Suppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite this and
17076 the other excellences.
17077 
17078 By all means.
17079 
17080 In the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the
17081 philosopher has to be ascertained. We must come to an understanding
17082 about him, and, when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we
17083 shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and
17084 that those in whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in
17085 the State.
17086 
17087 What do you mean?
17088 
17089 Let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort
17090 which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and
17091 corruption.
17092 
17093 Agreed.
17094 
17095 And further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true
17096 being; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less
17097 honourable, which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of the
17098 lover and the man of ambition.
17099 
17100 True.
17101 
17102 And if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another
17103 quality which they should also possess?
17104 
17105 What quality?
17106 
17107 Truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind
17108 falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.
17109 
17110 Yes, that may be safely affirmed of them.
17111 
17112 'May be,' my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather 'must be
17113 affirmed:' for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving
17114 all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.
17115 
17116 Right, he said.
17117 
17118 And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?
17119 
17120 How can there be?
17121 
17122 Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?
17123 
17124 Never.
17125 
17126 The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as
17127 in him lies, desire all truth?
17128 
17129 Assuredly.
17130 
17131 But then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong
17132 in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a
17133 stream which has been drawn off into another channel.
17134 
17135 True.
17136 
17137 He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be
17138 absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily
17139 pleasure--I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.
17140 
17141 That is most certain.
17142 
17143 Such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for the
17144 motives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have no
17145 place in his character.
17146 
17147 Very true.
17148 
17149 Another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered.
17150 
17151 What is that?
17152 
17153 There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more
17154 antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the
17155 whole of things both divine and human.
17156 
17157 Most true, he replied.
17158 
17159 Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all
17160 time and all existence, think much of human life?
17161 
17162 He cannot.
17163 
17164 Or can such an one account death fearful?
17165 
17166 No indeed.
17167 
17168 Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?
17169 
17170 Certainly not.
17171 
17172 Or again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous or
17173 mean, or a boaster, or a coward--can he, I say, ever be unjust or hard
17174 in his dealings?
17175 
17176 Impossible.
17177 
17178 Then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude
17179 and unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the
17180 philosophical nature from the unphilosophical.
17181 
17182 True.
17183 
17184 There is another point which should be remarked.
17185 
17186 What point?
17187 
17188 Whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love
17189 that which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little
17190 progress.
17191 
17192 Certainly not.
17193 
17194 And again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns,
17195 will he not be an empty vessel?
17196 
17197 That is certain.
17198 
17199 Labouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless
17200 occupation? Yes.
17201 
17202 Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic
17203 natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?
17204 
17205 Certainly.
17206 
17207 And once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to
17208 disproportion?
17209 
17210 Undoubtedly.
17211 
17212 And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?
17213 
17214 To proportion.
17215 
17216 Then, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally
17217 well-proportioned and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously
17218 towards the true being of everything.
17219 
17220 Certainly.
17221 
17222 Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating, go
17223 together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which is
17224 to have a full and perfect participation of being?
17225 
17226 They are absolutely necessary, he replied.
17227 
17228 And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has
17229 the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,--noble, gracious, the
17230 friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?
17231 
17232 The god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such a
17233 study.
17234 
17235 And to men like him, I said, when perfected by years and education, and
17236 to these only you will entrust the State.
17237 
17238 Here Adeimantus interposed and said: To these statements, Socrates, no
17239 one can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange feeling
17240 passes over the minds of your hearers: They fancy that they are led
17241 astray a little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want of
17242 skill in asking and answering questions; these littles accumulate, and
17243 at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty
17244 overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned upside down.
17245 And as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up by their
17246 more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move, so they too find
17247 themselves shut up at last; for they have nothing to say in this new
17248 game of which words are the counters; and yet all the time they are in
17249 the right. The observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring.
17250 For any one of us might say, that although in words he is not able
17251 to meet you at each step of the argument, he sees as a fact that the
17252 votaries of philosophy, when they carry on the study, not only in youth
17253 as a part of education, but as the pursuit of their maturer years, most
17254 of them become strange monsters, not to say utter rogues, and that those
17255 who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the world by
17256 the very study which you extol.
17257 
17258 Well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?
17259 
17260 I cannot tell, he replied; but I should like to know what is your
17261 opinion.
17262 
17263 Hear my answer; I am of opinion that they are quite right.
17264 
17265 Then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from
17266 evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are acknowledged
17267 by us to be of no use to them?
17268 
17269 You ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in a
17270 parable.
17271 
17272 Yes, Socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all
17273 accustomed, I suppose.
17274 
17275 I perceive, I said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into
17276 such a hopeless discussion; but now hear the parable, and then you will
17277 be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination: for the manner
17278 in which the best men are treated in their own States is so grievous
17279 that no single thing on earth is comparable to it; and therefore, if
17280 I am to plead their cause, I must have recourse to fiction, and put
17281 together a figure made up of many things, like the fabulous unions of
17282 goats and stags which are found in pictures. Imagine then a fleet or a
17283 ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of
17284 the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight,
17285 and his knowledge of navigation is not much better. The sailors are
17286 quarrelling with one another about the steering--every one is of opinion
17287 that he has a right to steer, though he has never learned the art of
17288 navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned, and will
17289 further assert that it cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in
17290 pieces any one who says the contrary. They throng about the captain,
17291 begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at any time
17292 they do not prevail, but others are preferred to them, they kill the
17293 others or throw them overboard, and having first chained up the noble
17294 captain's senses with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take
17295 possession of the ship and make free with the stores; thus, eating
17296 and drinking, they proceed on their voyage in such manner as might be
17297 expected of them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in
17298 their plot for getting the ship out of the captain's hands into their
17299 own whether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of
17300 sailor, pilot, able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they
17301 call a good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention
17302 to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else
17303 belongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command
17304 of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other
17305 people like or not--the possibility of this union of authority with the
17306 steerer's art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been
17307 made part of their calling. Now in vessels which are in a state of
17308 mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be
17309 regarded? Will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a
17310 good-for-nothing?
17311 
17312 Of course, said Adeimantus.
17313 
17314 Then you will hardly need, I said, to hear the interpretation of the
17315 figure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the
17316 State; for you understand already.
17317 
17318 Certainly.
17319 
17320 Then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised
17321 at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities; explain
17322 it to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be far
17323 more extraordinary.
17324 
17325 I will.
17326 
17327 Say to him, that, in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be
17328 useless to the rest of the world, he is right; but also tell him to
17329 attribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them,
17330 and not to themselves. The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be
17331 commanded by him--that is not the order of nature; neither are 'the wise
17332 to go to the doors of the rich'--the ingenious author of this saying
17333 told a lie--but the truth is, that, when a man is ill, whether he
17334 be rich or poor, to the physician he must go, and he who wants to
17335 be governed, to him who is able to govern. The ruler who is good for
17336 anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him; although
17337 the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp; they may be
17338 justly compared to the mutinous sailors, and the true helmsmen to those
17339 who are called by them good-for-nothings and star-gazers.
17340 
17341 Precisely so, he said.
17342 
17343 For these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest
17344 pursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the
17345 opposite faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done
17346 to her by her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same
17347 of whom you suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them
17348 are arrant rogues, and the best are useless; in which opinion I agreed.
17349 
17350 Yes.
17351 
17352 And the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?
17353 
17354 True.
17355 
17356 Then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is
17357 also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of
17358 philosophy any more than the other?
17359 
17360 By all means.
17361 
17362 And let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the description
17363 of the gentle and noble nature. Truth, as you will remember, was his
17364 leader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this, he
17365 was an impostor, and had no part or lot in true philosophy.
17366 
17367 Yes, that was said.
17368 
17369 Well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at
17370 variance with present notions of him?
17371 
17372 Certainly, he said.
17373 
17374 And have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover of
17375 knowledge is always striving after being--that is his nature; he will
17376 not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only,
17377 but will go on--the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force of his
17378 desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature
17379 of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul, and by
17380 that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very
17381 being, having begotten mind and truth, he will have knowledge and will
17382 live and grow truly, and then, and not till then, will he cease from his
17383 travail.
17384 
17385 Nothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of him.
17386 
17387 And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature? Will
17388 he not utterly hate a lie?
17389 
17390 He will.
17391 
17392 And when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band
17393 which he leads?
17394 
17395 Impossible.
17396 
17397 Justice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will
17398 follow after?
17399 
17400 True, he replied.
17401 
17402 Neither is there any reason why I should again set in array the
17403 philosopher's virtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage,
17404 magnificence, apprehension, memory, were his natural gifts. And you
17405 objected that, although no one could deny what I then said, still, if
17406 you leave words and look at facts, the persons who are thus described
17407 are some of them manifestly useless, and the greater number utterly
17408 depraved; we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these
17409 accusations, and have now arrived at the point of asking why are
17410 the majority bad, which question of necessity brought us back to the
17411 examination and definition of the true philosopher.
17412 
17413 Exactly.
17414 
17415 And we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic nature,
17416 why so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling--I am speaking of
17417 those who were said to be useless but not wicked--and, when we have done
17418 with them, we will speak of the imitators of philosophy, what manner of
17419 men are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of
17420 which they are unworthy, and then, by their manifold inconsistencies,
17421 bring upon philosophy, and upon all philosophers, that universal
17422 reprobation of which we speak.
17423 
17424 What are these corruptions? he said.
17425 
17426 I will see if I can explain them to you. Every one will admit that a
17427 nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a
17428 philosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men.
17429 
17430 Rare indeed.
17431 
17432 And what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare
17433 natures!
17434 
17435 What causes?
17436 
17437 In the first place there are their own virtues, their courage,
17438 temperance, and the rest of them, every one of which praiseworthy
17439 qualities (and this is a most singular circumstance) destroys and
17440 distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them.
17441 
17442 That is very singular, he replied.
17443 
17444 Then there are all the ordinary goods of life--beauty, wealth, strength,
17445 rank, and great connections in the State--you understand the sort of
17446 things--these also have a corrupting and distracting effect.
17447 
17448 I understand; but I should like to know more precisely what you mean
17449 about them.
17450 
17451 Grasp the truth as a whole, I said, and in the right way; you will then
17452 have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and they will
17453 no longer appear strange to you.
17454 
17455 And how am I to do so? he asked.
17456 
17457 Why, I said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or
17458 animal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil,
17459 in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the want of
17460 a suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than
17461 to what is not.
17462 
17463 Very true.
17464 
17465 There is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien
17466 conditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast
17467 is greater.
17468 
17469 Certainly.
17470 
17471 And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they
17472 are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? Do not great crimes and
17473 the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by
17474 education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are
17475 scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?
17476 
17477 There I think that you are right.
17478 
17479 And our philosopher follows the same analogy--he is like a plant which,
17480 having proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue,
17481 but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most noxious of
17482 all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. Do you really
17483 think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted by Sophists,
17484 or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth
17485 speaking of? Are not the public who say these things the greatest of all
17486 Sophists? And do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and
17487 women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?
17488 
17489 When is this accomplished? he said.
17490 
17491 When they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or in
17492 a court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular resort,
17493 and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which are
17494 being said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating both,
17495 shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and the
17496 place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or
17497 blame--at such a time will not a young man's heart, as they say, leap
17498 within him? Will any private training enable him to stand firm against
17499 the overwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will he be carried away
17500 by the stream? Will he not have the notions of good and evil which the
17501 public in general have--he will do as they do, and as they are, such
17502 will he be?
17503 
17504 Yes, Socrates; necessity will compel him.
17505 
17506 And yet, I said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not been
17507 mentioned.
17508 
17509 What is that?
17510 
17511 The gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death, which, as you
17512 are aware, these new Sophists and educators, who are the public, apply
17513 when their words are powerless.
17514 
17515 Indeed they do; and in right good earnest.
17516 
17517 Now what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, can be
17518 expected to overcome in such an unequal contest?
17519 
17520 None, he replied.
17521 
17522 No, indeed, I said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;
17523 there neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different
17524 type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that
17525 which is supplied by public opinion--I speak, my friend, of human virtue
17526 only; what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not included:
17527 for I would not have you ignorant that, in the present evil state of
17528 governments, whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power
17529 of God, as we may truly say.
17530 
17531 I quite assent, he replied.
17532 
17533 Then let me crave your assent also to a further observation.
17534 
17535 What are you going to say?
17536 
17537 Why, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call Sophists
17538 and whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing
17539 but the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their
17540 assemblies; and this is their wisdom. I might compare them to a man who
17541 should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is
17542 fed by him--he would learn how to approach and handle him, also at what
17543 times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and what
17544 is the meaning of his several cries, and by what sounds, when another
17545 utters them, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may suppose further,
17546 that when, by continually attending upon him, he has become perfect in
17547 all this, he calls his knowledge wisdom, and makes of it a system or
17548 art, which he proceeds to teach, although he has no real notion of what
17549 he means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking, but
17550 calls this honourable and that dishonourable, or good or evil, or just
17551 or unjust, all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great
17552 brute. Good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and
17553 evil to be that which he dislikes; and he can give no other account
17554 of them except that the just and noble are the necessary, having never
17555 himself seen, and having no power of explaining to others the nature
17556 of either, or the difference between them, which is immense. By heaven,
17557 would not such an one be a rare educator?
17558 
17559 Indeed he would.
17560 
17561 And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of
17562 the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting
17563 or music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been
17564 describing? For when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to
17565 them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done
17566 the State, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called
17567 necessity of Diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they
17568 praise. And yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in
17569 confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good. Did you
17570 ever hear any of them which were not?
17571 
17572 No, nor am I likely to hear.
17573 
17574 You recognise the truth of what I have been saying? Then let me ask you
17575 to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in
17576 the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful, or
17577 of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?
17578 
17579 Certainly not.
17580 
17581 Then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?
17582 
17583 Impossible.
17584 
17585 And therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the
17586 world?
17587 
17588 They must.
17589 
17590 And of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?
17591 
17592 That is evident.
17593 
17594 Then, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in
17595 his calling to the end? and remember what we were saying of him, that
17596 he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence--these
17597 were admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.
17598 
17599 Yes.
17600 
17601 Will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first
17602 among all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones?
17603 
17604 Certainly, he said.
17605 
17606 And his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets
17607 older for their own purposes?
17608 
17609 No question.
17610 
17611 Falling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him honour
17612 and flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the
17613 power which he will one day possess.
17614 
17615 That often happens, he said.
17616 
17617 And what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such
17618 circumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich
17619 and noble, and a tall proper youth? Will he not be full of boundless
17620 aspirations, and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes
17621 and of barbarians, and having got such notions into his head will he
17622 not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless
17623 pride?
17624 
17625 To be sure he will.
17626 
17627 Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him
17628 and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can
17629 only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse
17630 circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?
17631 
17632 Far otherwise.
17633 
17634 And even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural
17635 reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken
17636 captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they think that
17637 they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap
17638 from his companionship? Will they not do and say anything to prevent him
17639 from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless,
17640 using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions?
17641 
17642 There can be no doubt of it.
17643 
17644 And how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?
17645 
17646 Impossible.
17647 
17648 Then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which
17649 make a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from
17650 philosophy, no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other
17651 so-called goods of life?
17652 
17653 We were quite right.
17654 
17655 Thus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and failure
17656 which I have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of
17657 all pursuits; they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time;
17658 this being the class out of which come the men who are the authors of
17659 the greatest evil to States and individuals; and also of the greatest
17660 good when the tide carries them in that direction; but a small man never
17661 was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to States.
17662 
17663 That is most true, he said.
17664 
17665 And so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite incomplete:
17666 for her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they are
17667 leading a false and unbecoming life, other unworthy persons, seeing that
17668 she has no kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour her; and
17669 fasten upon her the reproaches which, as you say, her reprovers utter,
17670 who affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing, and that the
17671 greater number deserve the severest punishment.
17672 
17673 That is certainly what people say.
17674 
17675 Yes; and what else would you expect, I said, when you think of the puny
17676 creatures who, seeing this land open to them--a land well stocked with
17677 fair names and showy titles--like prisoners running out of prison into a
17678 sanctuary, take a leap out of their trades into philosophy; those who
17679 do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts?
17680 For, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there remains a
17681 dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts. And many are
17682 thus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are
17683 maimed and disfigured by their meannesses, as their bodies are by their
17684 trades and crafts. Is not this unavoidable?
17685 
17686 Yes.
17687 
17688 Are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of
17689 durance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a new coat,
17690 and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master's daughter,
17691 who is left poor and desolate?
17692 
17693 A most exact parallel.
17694 
17695 What will be the issue of such marriages? Will they not be vile and
17696 bastard?
17697 
17698 There can be no question of it.
17699 
17700 And when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and
17701 make an alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of
17702 ideas and opinions are likely to be generated? Will they not be sophisms
17703 captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or
17704 akin to true wisdom?
17705 
17706 No doubt, he said.
17707 
17708 Then, Adeimantus, I said, the worthy disciples of philosophy will be but
17709 a small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person, detained
17710 by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting influences
17711 remains devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean city, the
17712 politics of which he contemns and neglects; and there may be a gifted
17713 few who leave the arts, which they justly despise, and come to her;--or
17714 peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend Theages'
17715 bridle; for everything in the life of Theages conspired to divert him
17716 from philosophy; but ill-health kept him away from politics. My own case
17717 of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning, for rarely, if ever,
17718 has such a monitor been given to any other man. Those who belong to this
17719 small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy
17720 is, and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude; and they
17721 know that no politician is honest, nor is there any champion of justice
17722 at whose side they may fight and be saved. Such an one may be compared
17723 to a man who has fallen among wild beasts--he will not join in the
17724 wickedness of his fellows, but neither is he able singly to resist all
17725 their fierce natures, and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to
17726 the State or to his friends, and reflecting that he would have to throw
17727 away his life without doing any good either to himself or others, he
17728 holds his peace, and goes his own way. He is like one who, in the storm
17729 of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along, retires
17730 under the shelter of a wall; and seeing the rest of mankind full of
17731 wickedness, he is content, if only he can live his own life and be pure
17732 from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with
17733 bright hopes.
17734 
17735 Yes, he said, and he will have done a great work before he departs.
17736 
17737 A great work--yes; but not the greatest, unless he find a State suitable
17738 to him; for in a State which is suitable to him, he will have a larger
17739 growth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of himself.
17740 
17741 The causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been
17742 sufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has
17743 been shown--is there anything more which you wish to say?
17744 
17745 Nothing more on that subject, he replied; but I should like to know
17746 which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted
17747 to her.
17748 
17749 Not any of them, I said; and that is precisely the accusation which I
17750 bring against them--not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature,
17751 and hence that nature is warped and estranged;--as the exotic seed
17752 which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is wont to be
17753 overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil, even so this growth
17754 of philosophy, instead of persisting, degenerates and receives another
17755 character. But if philosophy ever finds in the State that perfection
17756 which she herself is, then will be seen that she is in truth divine, and
17757 that all other things, whether natures of men or institutions, are but
17758 human;--and now, I know, that you are going to ask, What that State is:
17759 
17760 No, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another
17761 question--whether it is the State of which we are the founders and
17762 inventors, or some other?
17763 
17764 Yes, I replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my saying
17765 before, that some living authority would always be required in the
17766 State having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as
17767 legislator you were laying down the laws.
17768 
17769 That was said, he replied.
17770 
17771 Yes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by interposing
17772 objections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and
17773 difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.
17774 
17775 What is there remaining?
17776 
17777 The question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be
17778 the ruin of the State: All great attempts are attended with risk; 'hard
17779 is the good,' as men say.
17780 
17781 Still, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will then
17782 be complete.
17783 
17784 I shall not be hindered, I said, by any want of will, but, if at all,
17785 by a want of power: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please to
17786 remark in what I am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly I declare
17787 that States should pursue philosophy, not as they do now, but in a
17788 different spirit.
17789 
17790 In what manner?
17791 
17792 At present, I said, the students of philosophy are quite young;
17793 beginning when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the time
17794 saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even those
17795 of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit, when
17796 they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject, I mean
17797 dialectic, take themselves off. In after life when invited by some one
17798 else, they may, perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about this they make
17799 much ado, for philosophy is not considered by them to be their
17800 proper business: at last, when they grow old, in most cases they are
17801 extinguished more truly than Heracleitus' sun, inasmuch as they never
17802 light up again. (Heraclitus said that the sun was extinguished every
17803 evening and relighted every morning.)
17804 
17805 But what ought to be their course?
17806 
17807 Just the opposite. In childhood and youth their study, and what
17808 philosophy they learn, should be suited to their tender years: during
17809 this period while they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and
17810 special care should be given to their bodies that they may have them
17811 to use in the service of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect
17812 begins to mature, let them increase the gymnastics of the soul; but
17813 when the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military
17814 duties, then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour,
17815 as we intend them to live happily here, and to crown this life with a
17816 similar happiness in another.
17817 
17818 How truly in earnest you are, Socrates! he said; I am sure of that; and
17819 yet most of your hearers, if I am not mistaken, are likely to be still
17820 more earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be convinced;
17821 Thrasymachus least of all.
17822 
17823 Do not make a quarrel, I said, between Thrasymachus and me, who have
17824 recently become friends, although, indeed, we were never enemies; for I
17825 shall go on striving to the utmost until I either convert him and other
17826 men, or do something which may profit them against the day when they
17827 live again, and hold the like discourse in another state of existence.
17828 
17829 You are speaking of a time which is not very near.
17830 
17831 Rather, I replied, of a time which is as nothing in comparison with
17832 eternity. Nevertheless, I do not wonder that the many refuse to believe;
17833 for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realized;
17834 they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy, consisting
17835 of words artificially brought together, not like these of ours having
17836 a natural unity. But a human being who in word and work is perfectly
17837 moulded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of
17838 virtue--such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image, they
17839 have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them--do you think that
17840 they ever did?
17841 
17842 No indeed.
17843 
17844 No, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble
17845 sentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means
17846 in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge, while
17847 they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the end is
17848 opinion and strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of law or
17849 in society.
17850 
17851 They are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.
17852 
17853 And this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth forced
17854 us to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor
17855 States nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small
17856 class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are
17857 providentially compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the
17858 State, and until a like necessity be laid on the State to obey them; or
17859 until kings, or if not kings, the sons of kings or princes, are divinely
17860 inspired with a true love of true philosophy. That either or both of
17861 these alternatives are impossible, I see no reason to affirm: if
17862 they were so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and
17863 visionaries. Am I not right?
17864 
17865 Quite right.
17866 
17867 If then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour in
17868 some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected
17869 philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior
17870 power to have the charge of the State, we are ready to assert to the
17871 death, that this our constitution has been, and is--yea, and will be
17872 whenever the Muse of Philosophy is queen. There is no impossibility in
17873 all this; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.
17874 
17875 My opinion agrees with yours, he said.
17876 
17877 But do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?
17878 
17879 I should imagine not, he replied.
17880 
17881 O my friend, I said, do not attack the multitude: they will change their
17882 minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with the view
17883 of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you show
17884 them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just
17885 now doing their character and profession, and then mankind will see that
17886 he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed--if they view
17887 him in this new light, they will surely change their notion of him, and
17888 answer in another strain. Who can be at enmity with one who loves them,
17889 who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one
17890 in whom there is no jealousy? Nay, let me answer for you, that in a few
17891 this harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of mankind.
17892 
17893 I quite agree with you, he said.
17894 
17895 And do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which the
17896 many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who rush
17897 in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with them,
17898 who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation? and
17899 nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this.
17900 
17901 It is most unbecoming.
17902 
17903 For he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely no
17904 time to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with malice
17905 and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed towards
17906 things fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor injured
17907 by one another, but all in order moving according to reason; these he
17908 imitates, and to these he will, as far as he can, conform himself. Can a
17909 man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse?
17910 
17911 Impossible.
17912 
17913 And the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes
17914 orderly and divine, as far as the nature of man allows; but like every
17915 one else, he will suffer from detraction.
17916 
17917 Of course.
17918 
17919 And if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself,
17920 but human nature generally, whether in States or individuals, into
17921 that which he beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful
17922 artificer of justice, temperance, and every civil virtue?
17923 
17924 Anything but unskilful.
17925 
17926 And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the
17927 truth, will they be angry with philosophy? Will they disbelieve us, when
17928 we tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed by artists
17929 who imitate the heavenly pattern?
17930 
17931 They will not be angry if they understand, he said. But how will they
17932 draw out the plan of which you are speaking?
17933 
17934 They will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from which,
17935 as from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean
17936 surface. This is no easy task. But whether easy or not, herein will lie
17937 the difference between them and every other legislator,--they will have
17938 nothing to do either with individual or State, and will inscribe no
17939 laws, until they have either found, or themselves made, a clean surface.
17940 
17941 They will be very right, he said.
17942 
17943 Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the
17944 constitution?
17945 
17946 No doubt.
17947 
17948 And when they are filling in the work, as I conceive, they will often
17949 turn their eyes upwards and downwards: I mean that they will first look
17950 at absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the human
17951 copy; and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the
17952 image of a man; and this they will conceive according to that other
17953 image, which, when existing among men, Homer calls the form and likeness
17954 of God.
17955 
17956 Very true, he said.
17957 
17958 And one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, until
17959 they have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the
17960 ways of God?
17961 
17962 Indeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.
17963 
17964 And now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described
17965 as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions
17966 is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant
17967 because to his hands we committed the State; and are they growing a
17968 little calmer at what they have just heard?
17969 
17970 Much calmer, if there is any sense in them.
17971 
17972 Why, where can they still find any ground for objection? Will they doubt
17973 that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?
17974 
17975 They would not be so unreasonable.
17976 
17977 Or that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the
17978 highest good?
17979 
17980 Neither can they doubt this.
17981 
17982 But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable
17983 circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was? Or
17984 will they prefer those whom we have rejected?
17985 
17986 Surely not.
17987 
17988 Then will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers
17989 bear rule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will
17990 this our imaginary State ever be realized?
17991 
17992 I think that they will be less angry.
17993 
17994 Shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle,
17995 and that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other
17996 reason, cannot refuse to come to terms?
17997 
17998 By all means, he said.
17999 
18000 Then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. Will any
18001 one deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes who
18002 are by nature philosophers?
18003 
18004 Surely no man, he said.
18005 
18006 And when they have come into being will any one say that they must of
18007 necessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied even
18008 by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can
18009 escape--who will venture to affirm this?
18010 
18011 Who indeed!
18012 
18013 But, said I, one is enough; let there be one man who has a city obedient
18014 to his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about
18015 which the world is so incredulous.
18016 
18017 Yes, one is enough.
18018 
18019 The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been
18020 describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?
18021 
18022 Certainly.
18023 
18024 And that others should approve, of what we approve, is no miracle or
18025 impossibility?
18026 
18027 I think not.
18028 
18029 But we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all this, if
18030 only possible, is assuredly for the best.
18031 
18032 We have.
18033 
18034 And now we say not only that our laws, if they could be enacted, would
18035 be for the best, but also that the enactment of them, though difficult,
18036 is not impossible.
18037 
18038 Very good.
18039 
18040 And so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, but
18041 more remains to be discussed;--how and by what studies and pursuits will
18042 the saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they
18043 to apply themselves to their several studies?
18044 
18045 Certainly.
18046 
18047 I omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and the
18048 procreation of children, and the appointment of the rulers, because
18049 I knew that the perfect State would be eyed with jealousy and was
18050 difficult of attainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much
18051 service to me, for I had to discuss them all the same. The women and
18052 children are now disposed of, but the other question of the rulers must
18053 be investigated from the very beginning. We were saying, as you will
18054 remember, that they were to be lovers of their country, tried by the
18055 test of pleasures and pains, and neither in hardships, nor in dangers,
18056 nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism--he was
18057 to be rejected who failed, but he who always came forth pure, like gold
18058 tried in the refiner's fire, was to be made a ruler, and to receive
18059 honours and rewards in life and after death. This was the sort of thing
18060 which was being said, and then the argument turned aside and veiled her
18061 face; not liking to stir the question which has now arisen.
18062 
18063 I perfectly remember, he said.
18064 
18065 Yes, my friend, I said, and I then shrank from hazarding the bold
18066 word; but now let me dare to say--that the perfect guardian must be a
18067 philosopher.
18068 
18069 Yes, he said, let that be affirmed.
18070 
18071 And do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts which
18072 were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly
18073 found in shreds and patches.
18074 
18075 What do you mean? he said.
18076 
18077 You are aware, I replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity,
18078 cleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that
18079 persons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and
18080 magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a
18081 peaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their impulses,
18082 and all solid principle goes out of them.
18083 
18084 Very true, he said.
18085 
18086 On the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be depended
18087 upon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are
18088 equally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are
18089 always in a torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any
18090 intellectual toil.
18091 
18092 Quite true.
18093 
18094 And yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to
18095 whom the higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share in any
18096 office or command.
18097 
18098 Certainly, he said.
18099 
18100 And will they be a class which is rarely found?
18101 
18102 Yes, indeed.
18103 
18104 Then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers
18105 and pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind of
18106 probation which we did not mention--he must be exercised also in many
18107 kinds of knowledge, to see whether the soul will be able to endure the
18108 highest of all, or will faint under them, as in any other studies and
18109 exercises.
18110 
18111 Yes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. But what do you mean
18112 by the highest of all knowledge?
18113 
18114 You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts; and
18115 distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and
18116 wisdom?
18117 
18118 Indeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I should not deserve to hear more.
18119 
18120 And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of
18121 them?
18122 
18123 To what do you refer?
18124 
18125 We were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them in
18126 their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at
18127 the end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular
18128 exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded.
18129 And you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you, and so
18130 the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate
18131 manner; whether you were satisfied or not, it is for you to say.
18132 
18133 Yes, he said, I thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair
18134 measure of truth.
18135 
18136 But, my friend, I said, a measure of such things which in any degree
18137 falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing
18138 imperfect is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to be
18139 contented and think that they need search no further.
18140 
18141 Not an uncommon case when people are indolent.
18142 
18143 Yes, I said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the
18144 State and of the laws.
18145 
18146 True.
18147 
18148 The guardian then, I said, must be required to take the longer circuit,
18149 and toil at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach
18150 the highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his
18151 proper calling.
18152 
18153 What, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this--higher than
18154 justice and the other virtues?
18155 
18156 Yes, I said, there is. And of the virtues too we must behold not the
18157 outline merely, as at present--nothing short of the most finished
18158 picture should satisfy us. When little things are elaborated with an
18159 infinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty
18160 and utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the
18161 highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!
18162 
18163 A right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from
18164 asking you what is this highest knowledge?
18165 
18166 Nay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard the
18167 answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I
18168 rather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have often
18169 been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all
18170 other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this.
18171 You can hardly be ignorant that of this I was about to speak, concerning
18172 which, as you have often heard me say, we know so little; and, without
18173 which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us
18174 nothing. Do you think that the possession of all other things is of
18175 any value if we do not possess the good? or the knowledge of all other
18176 things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?
18177 
18178 Assuredly not.
18179 
18180 You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good,
18181 but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge?
18182 
18183 Yes.
18184 
18185 And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by
18186 knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?
18187 
18188 How ridiculous!
18189 
18190 Yes, I said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance
18191 of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it--for the good they
18192 define to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood them when
18193 they use the term 'good'--this is of course ridiculous.
18194 
18195 Most true, he said.
18196 
18197 And those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for they
18198 are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good.
18199 
18200 Certainly.
18201 
18202 And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?
18203 
18204 True.
18205 
18206 There can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this
18207 question is involved.
18208 
18209 There can be none.
18210 
18211 Further, do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to seem
18212 to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no one is
18213 satisfied with the appearance of good--the reality is what they seek; in
18214 the case of the good, appearance is despised by every one.
18215 
18216 Very true, he said.
18217 
18218 Of this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all
18219 his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and
18220 yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same
18221 assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever
18222 good there is in other things,--of a principle such and so great as this
18223 ought the best men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted, to be
18224 in the darkness of ignorance?
18225 
18226 Certainly not, he said.
18227 
18228 I am sure, I said, that he who does not know how the beautiful and
18229 the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and
18230 I suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true
18231 knowledge of them.
18232 
18233 That, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.
18234 
18235 And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will be
18236 perfectly ordered?
18237 
18238 Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you
18239 conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure,
18240 or different from either?
18241 
18242 Aye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would
18243 not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters.
18244 
18245 True, Socrates; but I must say that one who like you has passed a
18246 lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the
18247 opinions of others, and never telling his own.
18248 
18249 Well, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?
18250 
18251 Not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right
18252 to do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.
18253 
18254 And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the
18255 best of them blind? You would not deny that those who have any true
18256 notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way
18257 along the road?
18258 
18259 Very true.
18260 
18261 And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when
18262 others will tell you of brightness and beauty?
18263 
18264 Still, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away just
18265 as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation
18266 of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the
18267 other virtues, we shall be satisfied.
18268 
18269 Yes, my friend, and I shall be at least equally satisfied, but I cannot
18270 help fearing that I shall fail, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring
18271 ridicule upon me. No, sweet sirs, let us not at present ask what is the
18272 actual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts
18273 would be an effort too great for me. But of the child of the good who
18274 is likest him, I would fain speak, if I could be sure that you wished to
18275 hear--otherwise, not.
18276 
18277 By all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain in
18278 our debt for the account of the parent.
18279 
18280 I do indeed wish, I replied, that I could pay, and you receive, the
18281 account of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,
18282 however, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have a
18283 care that I do not render a false account, although I have no intention
18284 of deceiving you.
18285 
18286 Yes, we will take all the care that we can: proceed.
18287 
18288 Yes, I said, but I must first come to an understanding with you, and
18289 remind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion,
18290 and at many other times.
18291 
18292 What?
18293 
18294 The old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and so
18295 of other things which we describe and define; to all of them the term
18296 'many' is applied.
18297 
18298 True, he said.
18299 
18300 And there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other
18301 things to which the term 'many' is applied there is an absolute; for
18302 they may be brought under a single idea, which is called the essence of
18303 each.
18304 
18305 Very true.
18306 
18307 The many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known but
18308 not seen.
18309 
18310 Exactly.
18311 
18312 And what is the organ with which we see the visible things?
18313 
18314 The sight, he said.
18315 
18316 And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses
18317 perceive the other objects of sense?
18318 
18319 True.
18320 
18321 But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex
18322 piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?
18323 
18324 No, I never have, he said.
18325 
18326 Then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional
18327 nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be
18328 heard?
18329 
18330 Nothing of the sort.
18331 
18332 No, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the
18333 other senses--you would not say that any of them requires such an
18334 addition?
18335 
18336 Certainly not.
18337 
18338 But you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no
18339 seeing or being seen?
18340 
18341 How do you mean?
18342 
18343 Sight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting to
18344 see; colour being also present in them, still unless there be a third
18345 nature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will see
18346 nothing and the colours will be invisible.
18347 
18348 Of what nature are you speaking?
18349 
18350 Of that which you term light, I replied.
18351 
18352 True, he said.
18353 
18354 Noble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility, and
18355 great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for light is
18356 their bond, and light is no ignoble thing?
18357 
18358 Nay, he said, the reverse of ignoble.
18359 
18360 And which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of
18361 this element? Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly
18362 and the visible to appear?
18363 
18364 You mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.
18365 
18366 May not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?
18367 
18368 How?
18369 
18370 Neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?
18371 
18372 No.
18373 
18374 Yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun?
18375 
18376 By far the most like.
18377 
18378 And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is
18379 dispensed from the sun?
18380 
18381 Exactly.
18382 
18383 Then the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised by
18384 sight?
18385 
18386 True, he said.
18387 
18388 And this is he whom I call the child of the good, whom the good begat in
18389 his own likeness, to be in the visible world, in relation to sight
18390 and the things of sight, what the good is in the intellectual world in
18391 relation to mind and the things of mind:
18392 
18393 Will you be a little more explicit? he said.
18394 
18395 Why, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them towards
18396 objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon
18397 and stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no
18398 clearness of vision in them?
18399 
18400 Very true.
18401 
18402 But when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines, they
18403 see clearly and there is sight in them?
18404 
18405 Certainly.
18406 
18407 And the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth and
18408 being shine, the soul perceives and understands, and is radiant with
18409 intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and
18410 perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and
18411 is first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no
18412 intelligence?
18413 
18414 Just so.
18415 
18416 Now, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to
18417 the knower is what I would have you term the idea of good, and this
18418 you will deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so far as
18419 the latter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both
18420 truth and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature as
18421 more beautiful than either; and, as in the previous instance, light and
18422 sight may be truly said to be like the sun, and yet not to be the sun,
18423 so in this other sphere, science and truth may be deemed to be like the
18424 good, but not the good; the good has a place of honour yet higher.
18425 
18426 What a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of
18427 science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely
18428 cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good?
18429 
18430 God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in
18431 another point of view?
18432 
18433 In what point of view?
18434 
18435 You would say, would you not, that the sun is not only the author of
18436 visibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and
18437 growth, though he himself is not generation?
18438 
18439 Certainly.
18440 
18441 In like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of
18442 knowledge to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet
18443 the good is not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.
18444 
18445 Glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of heaven, how
18446 amazing!
18447 
18448 Yes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you made
18449 me utter my fancies.
18450 
18451 And pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there is
18452 anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.
18453 
18454 Yes, I said, there is a great deal more.
18455 
18456 Then omit nothing, however slight.
18457 
18458 I will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal will
18459 have to be omitted.
18460 
18461 I hope not, he said.
18462 
18463 You have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers, and that
18464 one of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the
18465 visible. I do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing
18466 upon the name ('ourhanoz, orhatoz'). May I suppose that you have this
18467 distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?
18468 
18469 I have.
18470 
18471 Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide
18472 each of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two
18473 main divisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the
18474 intelligible, and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their
18475 clearness and want of clearness, and you will find that the first
18476 section in the sphere of the visible consists of images. And by images I
18477 mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections
18478 in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you
18479 understand?
18480 
18481 Yes, I understand.
18482 
18483 Imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance,
18484 to include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is
18485 made.
18486 
18487 Very good.
18488 
18489 Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have
18490 different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the
18491 sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?
18492 
18493 Most undoubtedly.
18494 
18495 Next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the
18496 intellectual is to be divided.
18497 
18498 In what manner?
18499 
18500 Thus:--There are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses
18501 the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only
18502 be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends
18503 to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of
18504 hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making
18505 no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only in and
18506 through the ideas themselves.
18507 
18508 I do not quite understand your meaning, he said.
18509 
18510 Then I will try again; you will understand me better when I have made
18511 some preliminary remarks. You are aware that students of geometry,
18512 arithmetic, and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the
18513 figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches
18514 of science; these are their hypotheses, which they and every body are
18515 supposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give any account of
18516 them either to themselves or others; but they begin with them, and go
18517 on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner, at their
18518 conclusion?
18519 
18520 Yes, he said, I know.
18521 
18522 And do you not know also that although they make use of the visible
18523 forms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the
18524 ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but
18525 of the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on--the forms
18526 which they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water
18527 of their own, are converted by them into images, but they are really
18528 seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the
18529 eye of the mind?
18530 
18531 That is true.
18532 
18533 And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible, although in the search
18534 after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to
18535 a first principle, because she is unable to rise above the region of
18536 hypothesis, but employing the objects of which the shadows below are
18537 resemblances in their turn as images, they having in relation to the
18538 shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness, and therefore a
18539 higher value.
18540 
18541 I understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of geometry
18542 and the sister arts.
18543 
18544 And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will
18545 understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason
18546 herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as
18547 first principles, but only as hypotheses--that is to say, as steps and
18548 points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order
18549 that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and
18550 clinging to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive
18551 steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object, from
18552 ideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.
18553 
18554 I understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to
18555 be describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, I
18556 understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of
18557 dialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as
18558 they are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also
18559 contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because
18560 they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who
18561 contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason
18562 upon them, although when a first principle is added to them they are
18563 cognizable by the higher reason. And the habit which is concerned
18564 with geometry and the cognate sciences I suppose that you would term
18565 understanding and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion and
18566 reason.
18567 
18568 You have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, corresponding to
18569 these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul--reason
18570 answering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or
18571 conviction) to the third, and perception of shadows to the last--and let
18572 there be a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties
18573 have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth.
18574 
18575 I understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your
18576 arrangement.
18577 
18578 
18579 
18580 
18581 BOOK VII.
18582 
18583 And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is
18584 enlightened or unenlightened:--Behold! human beings living in a
18585 underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching
18586 all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have
18587 their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only
18588 see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round
18589 their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and
18590 between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will
18591 see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which
18592 marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the
18593 puppets.
18594 
18595 I see.
18596 
18597 And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of
18598 vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and
18599 various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking,
18600 others silent.
18601 
18602 You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.
18603 
18604 Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the
18605 shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of
18606 the cave?
18607 
18608 True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were
18609 never allowed to move their heads?
18610 
18611 And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would
18612 only see the shadows?
18613 
18614 Yes, he said.
18615 
18616 And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not
18617 suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?
18618 
18619 Very true.
18620 
18621 And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the
18622 other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by
18623 spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?
18624 
18625 No question, he replied.
18626 
18627 To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of
18628 the images.
18629 
18630 That is certain.
18631 
18632 And now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners
18633 are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is
18634 liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and
18635 walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare
18636 will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which
18637 in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one
18638 saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now,
18639 when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards
18640 more real existence, he has a clearer vision,--what will be his reply?
18641 And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the
18642 objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,--will he not be
18643 perplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are
18644 truer than the objects which are now shown to him?
18645 
18646 Far truer.
18647 
18648 And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have
18649 a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the
18650 objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in
18651 reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?
18652 
18653 True, he said.
18654 
18655 And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and
18656 rugged ascent, and held fast until he is forced into the presence of
18657 the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When he
18658 approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able
18659 to see anything at all of what are now called realities.
18660 
18661 Not all in a moment, he said.
18662 
18663 He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world.
18664 And first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and
18665 other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he
18666 will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled
18667 heaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the
18668 sun or the light of the sun by day?
18669 
18670 Certainly.
18671 
18672 Last of all he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of
18673 him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not
18674 in another; and he will contemplate him as he is.
18675 
18676 Certainly.
18677 
18678 He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and
18679 the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and
18680 in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have
18681 been accustomed to behold?
18682 
18683 Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.
18684 
18685 And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den
18686 and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate
18687 himself on the change, and pity them?
18688 
18689 Certainly, he would.
18690 
18691 And if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves
18692 on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark
18693 which of them went before, and which followed after, and which were
18694 together; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the
18695 future, do you think that he would care for such honours and glories, or
18696 envy the possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer,
18697 
18698 'Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,'
18699 
18700 and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after
18701 their manner?
18702 
18703 Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than
18704 entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.
18705 
18706 Imagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the sun
18707 to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have his
18708 eyes full of darkness?
18709 
18710 To be sure, he said.
18711 
18712 And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the
18713 shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while
18714 his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the
18715 time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be
18716 very considerable), would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him
18717 that up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was
18718 better not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose
18719 another and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender,
18720 and they would put him to death.
18721 
18722 No question, he said.
18723 
18724 This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to the
18725 previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of
18726 the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret
18727 the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual
18728 world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have
18729 expressed--whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or
18730 false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good
18731 appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen,
18732 is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and
18733 right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world,
18734 and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and
18735 that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in
18736 public or private life must have his eye fixed.
18737 
18738 I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.
18739 
18740 Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this
18741 beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their
18742 souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to
18743 dwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be
18744 trusted.
18745 
18746 Yes, very natural.
18747 
18748 And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine
18749 contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a
18750 ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has
18751 become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight
18752 in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of
18753 images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those
18754 who have never yet seen absolute justice?
18755 
18756 Anything but surprising, he replied.
18757 
18758 Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the
18759 eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out
18760 of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's
18761 eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when
18762 he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too
18763 ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out
18764 of the brighter life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the
18765 dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess
18766 of light. And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of
18767 being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the
18768 soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason
18769 in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of
18770 the light into the den.
18771 
18772 That, he said, is a very just distinction.
18773 
18774 But then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong
18775 when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not
18776 there before, like sight into blind eyes.
18777 
18778 They undoubtedly say this, he replied.
18779 
18780 Whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning
18781 exists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn
18782 from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of
18783 knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the
18784 world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure
18785 the sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or in other
18786 words, of the good.
18787 
18788 Very true.
18789 
18790 And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the
18791 easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for
18792 that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is
18793 looking away from the truth?
18794 
18795 Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed.
18796 
18797 And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to
18798 bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can
18799 be implanted later by habit and exercise, the virtue of wisdom more than
18800 anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by
18801 this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other
18802 hand, hurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow intelligence
18803 flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue--how eager he is, how
18804 clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the reverse of
18805 blind, but his keen eye-sight is forced into the service of evil, and he
18806 is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness?
18807 
18808 Very true, he said.
18809 
18810 But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days
18811 of their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures,
18812 such as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached
18813 to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision
18814 of their souls upon the things that are below--if, I say, they had been
18815 released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,
18816 the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as
18817 they see what their eyes are turned to now.
18818 
18819 Very likely.
18820 
18821 Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a
18822 necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated
18823 and uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of
18824 their education, will be able ministers of State; not the former,
18825 because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their
18826 actions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will
18827 not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already
18828 dwelling apart in the islands of the blest.
18829 
18830 Very true, he replied.
18831 
18832 Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State
18833 will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have
18834 already shown to be the greatest of all--they must continue to ascend
18835 until they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen
18836 enough we must not allow them to do as they do now.
18837 
18838 What do you mean?
18839 
18840 I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be
18841 allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the
18842 den, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth
18843 having or not.
18844 
18845 But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life,
18846 when they might have a better?
18847 
18848 You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the
18849 legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy
18850 above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he
18851 held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them
18852 benefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another;
18853 to this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his
18854 instruments in binding up the State.
18855 
18856 True, he said, I had forgotten.
18857 
18858 Observe, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our
18859 philosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain
18860 to them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to
18861 share in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up
18862 at their own sweet will, and the government would rather not have them.
18863 Being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a
18864 culture which they have never received. But we have brought you into
18865 the world to be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the other
18866 citizens, and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they
18867 have been educated, and you are better able to share in the double duty.
18868 Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the general
18869 underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. When you
18870 have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times better than the
18871 inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the several images are,
18872 and what they represent, because you have seen the beautiful and just
18873 and good in their truth. And thus our State, which is also yours, will
18874 be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be administered in a spirit
18875 unlike that of other States, in which men fight with one another about
18876 shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power, which in
18877 their eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth is that the State in which
18878 the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most
18879 quietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager, the worst.
18880 
18881 Quite true, he replied.
18882 
18883 And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at
18884 the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of
18885 their time with one another in the heavenly light?
18886 
18887 Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which
18888 we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of
18889 them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion of
18890 our present rulers of State.
18891 
18892 Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive for
18893 your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and
18894 then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which
18895 offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold,
18896 but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas
18897 if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering
18898 after their own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to
18899 snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they will be
18900 fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus
18901 arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.
18902 
18903 Most true, he replied.
18904 
18905 And the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition
18906 is that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other?
18907 
18908 Indeed, I do not, he said.
18909 
18910 And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they
18911 are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.
18912 
18913 No question.
18914 
18915 Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they
18916 will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the
18917 State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours
18918 and another and a better life than that of politics?
18919 
18920 They are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.
18921 
18922 And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced,
18923 and how they are to be brought from darkness to light,--as some are said
18924 to have ascended from the world below to the gods?
18925 
18926 By all means, he replied.
18927 
18928 The process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell (In
18929 allusion to a game in which two parties fled or pursued according as an
18930 oyster-shell which was thrown into the air fell with the dark or light
18931 side uppermost.), but the turning round of a soul passing from a day
18932 which is little better than night to the true day of being, that is, the
18933 ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?
18934 
18935 Quite so.
18936 
18937 And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of
18938 effecting such a change?
18939 
18940 Certainly.
18941 
18942 What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming
18943 to being? And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will
18944 remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?
18945 
18946 Yes, that was said.
18947 
18948 Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?
18949 
18950 What quality?
18951 
18952 Usefulness in war.
18953 
18954 Yes, if possible.
18955 
18956 There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?
18957 
18958 Just so.
18959 
18960 There was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the
18961 body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and
18962 corruption?
18963 
18964 True.
18965 
18966 Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?
18967 
18968 No.
18969 
18970 But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent
18971 into our former scheme?
18972 
18973 Music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,
18974 and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making
18975 them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and
18976 the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of
18977 rhythm and harmony in them. But in music there was nothing which tended
18978 to that good which you are now seeking.
18979 
18980 You are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music there
18981 certainly was nothing of the kind. But what branch of knowledge is
18982 there, my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the
18983 useful arts were reckoned mean by us?
18984 
18985 Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts
18986 are also excluded, what remains?
18987 
18988 Well, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and
18989 then we shall have to take something which is not special, but of
18990 universal application.
18991 
18992 What may that be?
18993 
18994 A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common,
18995 and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education.
18996 
18997 What is that?
18998 
18999 The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three--in a word,
19000 number and calculation:--do not all arts and sciences necessarily
19001 partake of them?
19002 
19003 Yes.
19004 
19005 Then the art of war partakes of them?
19006 
19007 To be sure.
19008 
19009 Then Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon
19010 ridiculously unfit to be a general. Did you never remark how he declares
19011 that he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array
19012 the ranks of the army at Troy; which implies that they had never been
19013 numbered before, and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been
19014 incapable of counting his own feet--how could he if he was ignorant of
19015 number? And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?
19016 
19017 I should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.
19018 
19019 Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?
19020 
19021 Certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of
19022 military tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man
19023 at all.
19024 
19025 I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of
19026 this study?
19027 
19028 What is your notion?
19029 
19030 It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and
19031 which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly
19032 used; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.
19033 
19034 Will you explain your meaning? he said.
19035 
19036 I will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with me,
19037 and say 'yes' or 'no' when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind what
19038 branches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may
19039 have clearer proof that arithmetic is, as I suspect, one of them.
19040 
19041 Explain, he said.
19042 
19043 I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them do
19044 not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them; while
19045 in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further
19046 enquiry is imperatively demanded.
19047 
19048 You are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses
19049 are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.
19050 
19051 No, I said, that is not at all my meaning.
19052 
19053 Then what is your meaning?
19054 
19055 When speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not pass from
19056 one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which do; in
19057 this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a distance
19058 or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its
19059 opposite. An illustration will make my meaning clearer:--here are three
19060 fingers--a little finger, a second finger, and a middle finger.
19061 
19062 Very good.
19063 
19064 You may suppose that they are seen quite close: And here comes the
19065 point.
19066 
19067 What is it?
19068 
19069 Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or
19070 at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin--it makes no
19071 difference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases a man is
19072 not compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger? for the
19073 sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.
19074 
19075 True.
19076 
19077 And therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which
19078 invites or excites intelligence.
19079 
19080 There is not, he said.
19081 
19082 But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?
19083 Can sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the
19084 circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at
19085 the extremity? And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the
19086 qualities of thickness or thinness, of softness or hardness? And so of
19087 the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters? Is
19088 not their mode of operation on this wise--the sense which is concerned
19089 with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the
19090 quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing
19091 is felt to be both hard and soft?
19092 
19093 You are quite right, he said.
19094 
19095 And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense
19096 gives of a hard which is also soft? What, again, is the meaning of
19097 light and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is
19098 heavy, light?
19099 
19100 Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very curious
19101 and require to be explained.
19102 
19103 Yes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her
19104 aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the several
19105 objects announced to her are one or two.
19106 
19107 True.
19108 
19109 And if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?
19110 
19111 Certainly.
19112 
19113 And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in
19114 a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be
19115 conceived of as one?
19116 
19117 True.
19118 
19119 The eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a confused
19120 manner; they were not distinguished.
19121 
19122 Yes.
19123 
19124 Whereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was
19125 compelled to reverse the process, and look at small and great as
19126 separate and not confused.
19127 
19128 Very true.
19129 
19130 Was not this the beginning of the enquiry 'What is great?' and 'What is
19131 small?'
19132 
19133 Exactly so.
19134 
19135 And thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.
19136 
19137 Most true.
19138 
19139 This was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the
19140 intellect, or the reverse--those which are simultaneous with opposite
19141 impressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.
19142 
19143 I understand, he said, and agree with you.
19144 
19145 And to which class do unity and number belong?
19146 
19147 I do not know, he replied.
19148 
19149 Think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the
19150 answer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight
19151 or by any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of the
19152 finger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there
19153 is some contradiction always present, and one is the reverse of one and
19154 involves the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused
19155 within us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision
19156 asks 'What is absolute unity?' This is the way in which the study of the
19157 one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation
19158 of true being.
19159 
19160 And surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see
19161 the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?
19162 
19163 Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all
19164 number?
19165 
19166 Certainly.
19167 
19168 And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?
19169 
19170 Yes.
19171 
19172 And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?
19173 
19174 Yes, in a very remarkable manner.
19175 
19176 Then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a
19177 double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn
19178 the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the
19179 philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and
19180 lay hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.
19181 
19182 That is true.
19183 
19184 And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?
19185 
19186 Certainly.
19187 
19188 Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe;
19189 and we must endeavour to persuade those who are to be the principal men
19190 of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they must
19191 carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind
19192 only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying
19193 or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul
19194 herself; and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from
19195 becoming to truth and being.
19196 
19197 That is excellent, he said.
19198 
19199 Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming the
19200 science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if
19201 pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!
19202 
19203 How do you mean?
19204 
19205 I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating
19206 effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and
19207 rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into
19208 the argument. You know how steadily the masters of the art repel and
19209 ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is
19210 calculating, and if you divide, they multiply (Meaning either (1)
19211 that they integrate the number because they deny the possibility of
19212 fractions; or (2) that division is regarded by them as a process of
19213 multiplication, for the fractions of one continue to be units.), taking
19214 care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.
19215 
19216 That is very true.
19217 
19218 Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these
19219 wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say,
19220 there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable,
19221 indivisible,--what would they answer?
19222 
19223 They would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of
19224 those numbers which can only be realized in thought.
19225 
19226 Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary,
19227 necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the
19228 attainment of pure truth?
19229 
19230 Yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.
19231 
19232 And have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for
19233 calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and
19234 even the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they
19235 may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than
19236 they would otherwise have been.
19237 
19238 Very true, he said.
19239 
19240 And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not
19241 many as difficult.
19242 
19243 You will not.
19244 
19245 And, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which
19246 the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.
19247 
19248 I agree.
19249 
19250 Let this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next, shall
19251 we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?
19252 
19253 You mean geometry?
19254 
19255 Exactly so.
19256 
19257 Clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which
19258 relates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position,
19259 or closing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military
19260 manoeuvre, whether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the
19261 difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician.
19262 
19263 Yes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or
19264 calculation will be enough; the question relates rather to the greater
19265 and more advanced part of geometry--whether that tends in any degree
19266 to make more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither, as I was
19267 saying, all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards
19268 that place, where is the full perfection of being, which she ought, by
19269 all means, to behold.
19270 
19271 True, he said.
19272 
19273 Then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming
19274 only, it does not concern us?
19275 
19276 Yes, that is what we assert.
19277 
19278 Yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny
19279 that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the
19280 ordinary language of geometricians.
19281 
19282 How so?
19283 
19284 They have in view practice only, and are always speaking, in a narrow
19285 and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the
19286 like--they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life;
19287 whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.
19288 
19289 Certainly, he said.
19290 
19291 Then must not a further admission be made?
19292 
19293 What admission?
19294 
19295 That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal,
19296 and not of aught perishing and transient.
19297 
19298 That, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.
19299 
19300 Then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth,
19301 and create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now
19302 unhappily allowed to fall down.
19303 
19304 Nothing will be more likely to have such an effect.
19305 
19306 Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants
19307 of your fair city should by all means learn geometry. Moreover the
19308 science has indirect effects, which are not small.
19309 
19310 Of what kind? he said.
19311 
19312 There are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and in all
19313 departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied
19314 geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not.
19315 
19316 Yes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them.
19317 
19318 Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our
19319 youth will study?
19320 
19321 Let us do so, he replied.
19322 
19323 And suppose we make astronomy the third--what do you say?
19324 
19325 I am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons
19326 and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the
19327 farmer or sailor.
19328 
19329 I am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you guard
19330 against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite
19331 admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye
19332 of the soul which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these
19333 purified and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand
19334 bodily eyes, for by it alone is truth seen. Now there are two classes of
19335 persons: one class of those who will agree with you and will take
19336 your words as a revelation; another class to whom they will be utterly
19337 unmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for they
19338 see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them. And therefore
19339 you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to
19340 argue. You will very likely say with neither, and that your chief aim in
19341 carrying on the argument is your own improvement; at the same time you
19342 do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive.
19343 
19344 I think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own
19345 behalf.
19346 
19347 Then take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of the
19348 sciences.
19349 
19350 What was the mistake? he said.
19351 
19352 After plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to solids in
19353 revolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the
19354 second dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions
19355 of depth, ought to have followed.
19356 
19357 That is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about
19358 these subjects.
19359 
19360 Why, yes, I said, and for two reasons:--in the first place, no
19361 government patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the
19362 pursuit of them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students
19363 cannot learn them unless they have a director. But then a director
19364 can hardly be found, and even if he could, as matters now stand,
19365 the students, who are very conceited, would not attend to him. That,
19366 however, would be otherwise if the whole State became the director of
19367 these studies and gave honour to them; then disciples would want to
19368 come, and there would be continuous and earnest search, and discoveries
19369 would be made; since even now, disregarded as they are by the world, and
19370 maimed of their fair proportions, and although none of their votaries
19371 can tell the use of them, still these studies force their way by their
19372 natural charm, and very likely, if they had the help of the State, they
19373 would some day emerge into light.
19374 
19375 Yes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. But I do not clearly
19376 understand the change in the order. First you began with a geometry of
19377 plane surfaces?
19378 
19379 Yes, I said.
19380 
19381 And you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?
19382 
19383 Yes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid
19384 geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass
19385 over this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.
19386 
19387 True, he said.
19388 
19389 Then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence
19390 if encouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will be
19391 fourth.
19392 
19393 The right order, he replied. And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the
19394 vulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before, my praise shall
19395 be given in your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that
19396 astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world
19397 to another.
19398 
19399 Every one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, but
19400 not to me.
19401 
19402 And what then would you say?
19403 
19404 I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy
19405 appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.
19406 
19407 What do you mean? he asked.
19408 
19409 You, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our
19410 knowledge of the things above. And I dare say that if a person were to
19411 throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still think
19412 that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. And you are very
19413 likely right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that
19414 knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul
19415 look upwards, and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the
19416 ground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, I would deny that he
19417 can learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of science; his soul is
19418 looking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by water
19419 or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.
19420 
19421 I acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I should like
19422 to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive
19423 to that knowledge of which we are speaking?
19424 
19425 I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought
19426 upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most
19427 perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to
19428 the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are
19429 relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in
19430 them, in the true number and in every true figure. Now, these are to be
19431 apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.
19432 
19433 True, he replied.
19434 
19435 The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that
19436 higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures
19437 excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other great artist,
19438 which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would
19439 appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he would never
19440 dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true
19441 double, or the truth of any other proportion.
19442 
19443 No, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.
19444 
19445 And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at
19446 the movements of the stars? Will he not think that heaven and the things
19447 in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect manner?
19448 But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of
19449 both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the stars to these
19450 and to one another, and any other things that are material and visible
19451 can also be eternal and subject to no deviation--that would be absurd;
19452 and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their
19453 exact truth.
19454 
19455 I quite agree, though I never thought of this before.
19456 
19457 Then, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems,
19458 and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right
19459 way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.
19460 
19461 That, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.
19462 
19463 Yes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have a
19464 similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any
19465 value. But can you tell me of any other suitable study?
19466 
19467 No, he said, not without thinking.
19468 
19469 Motion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are
19470 obvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others,
19471 as I imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.
19472 
19473 But where are the two?
19474 
19475 There is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already
19476 named.
19477 
19478 And what may that be?
19479 
19480 The second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the
19481 first is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to
19482 look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and
19483 these are sister sciences--as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon,
19484 agree with them?
19485 
19486 Yes, he replied.
19487 
19488 But this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better go
19489 and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other
19490 applications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose sight
19491 of our own higher object.
19492 
19493 What is that?
19494 
19495 There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our
19496 pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying
19497 that they did in astronomy. For in the science of harmony, as you
19498 probably know, the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony compare
19499 the sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like
19500 that of the astronomers, is in vain.
19501 
19502 Yes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them talking
19503 about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears
19504 close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their
19505 neighbour's wall--one set of them declaring that they distinguish an
19506 intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be
19507 the unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have
19508 passed into the same--either party setting their ears before their
19509 understanding.
19510 
19511 You mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and
19512 rack them on the pegs of the instrument: I might carry on the metaphor
19513 and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives,
19514 and make accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and
19515 forwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will
19516 only say that these are not the men, and that I am referring to the
19517 Pythagoreans, of whom I was just now proposing to enquire about harmony.
19518 For they too are in error, like the astronomers; they investigate the
19519 numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they never attain to
19520 problems--that is to say, they never reach the natural harmonies of
19521 number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not.
19522 
19523 That, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.
19524 
19525 A thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if sought
19526 after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in any other
19527 spirit, useless.
19528 
19529 Very true, he said.
19530 
19531 Now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and
19532 connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual
19533 affinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them
19534 have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.
19535 
19536 I suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast work.
19537 
19538 What do you mean? I said; the prelude or what? Do you not know that all
19539 this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn? For
19540 you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?
19541 
19542 Assuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was
19543 capable of reasoning.
19544 
19545 But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason
19546 will have the knowledge which we require of them?
19547 
19548 Neither can this be supposed.
19549 
19550 And so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of
19551 dialectic. This is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which
19552 the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight,
19553 as you may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold the
19554 real animals and stars, and last of all the sun himself. And so with
19555 dialectic; when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by
19556 the light of reason only, and without any assistance of sense, and
19557 perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception
19558 of the absolute good, he at last finds himself at the end of the
19559 intellectual world, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.
19560 
19561 Exactly, he said.
19562 
19563 Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?
19564 
19565 True.
19566 
19567 But the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation
19568 from the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from the
19569 underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly trying
19570 to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are able to
19571 perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water (which are
19572 divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows of images
19573 cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only an
19574 image)--this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to
19575 the contemplation of that which is best in existence, with which we may
19576 compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body
19577 to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible
19578 world--this power is given, as I was saying, by all that study and
19579 pursuit of the arts which has been described.
19580 
19581 I agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to
19582 believe, yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny. This,
19583 however, is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but will have
19584 to be discussed again and again. And so, whether our conclusion be true
19585 or false, let us assume all this, and proceed at once from the prelude
19586 or preamble to the chief strain (A play upon the Greek word, which means
19587 both 'law' and 'strain.'), and describe that in like manner. Say, then,
19588 what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic, and what
19589 are the paths which lead thither; for these paths will also lead to our
19590 final rest.
19591 
19592 Dear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, though
19593 I would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the
19594 absolute truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would
19595 or would not have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would
19596 have seen something like reality; of that I am confident.
19597 
19598 Doubtless, he replied.
19599 
19600 But I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can reveal
19601 this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.
19602 
19603 Of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.
19604 
19605 And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method
19606 of comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of
19607 ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in
19608 general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are
19609 cultivated with a view to production and construction, or for the
19610 preservation of such productions and constructions; and as to the
19611 mathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some apprehension
19612 of true being--geometry and the like--they only dream about being,
19613 but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the
19614 hypotheses which they use unexamined, and are unable to give an account
19615 of them. For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the
19616 conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows
19617 not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever
19618 become science?
19619 
19620 Impossible, he said.
19621 
19622 Then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first
19623 principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in
19624 order to make her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is literally
19625 buried in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards;
19626 and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the
19627 sciences which we have been discussing. Custom terms them sciences,
19628 but they ought to have some other name, implying greater clearness
19629 than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in our previous
19630 sketch, was called understanding. But why should we dispute about names
19631 when we have realities of such importance to consider?
19632 
19633 Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought
19634 of the mind with clearness?
19635 
19636 At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions;
19637 two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division
19638 science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth
19639 perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and
19640 intellect with being; and so to make a proportion:--
19641 
19642 As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. And as
19643 intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to
19644 the perception of shadows.
19645 
19646 But let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects
19647 of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry, many times
19648 longer than this has been.
19649 
19650 As far as I understand, he said, I agree.
19651 
19652 And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one who
19653 attains a conception of the essence of each thing? And he who does not
19654 possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in
19655 whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in
19656 intelligence? Will you admit so much?
19657 
19658 Yes, he said; how can I deny it?
19659 
19660 And you would say the same of the conception of the good? Until the
19661 person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good,
19662 and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to
19663 disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never
19664 faltering at any step of the argument--unless he can do all this, you
19665 would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he
19666 apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion
19667 and not by science;--dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he
19668 is well awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final
19669 quietus.
19670 
19671 In all that I should most certainly agree with you.
19672 
19673 And surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom you
19674 are nurturing and educating--if the ideal ever becomes a reality--you
19675 would not allow the future rulers to be like posts (Literally 'lines,'
19676 probably the starting-point of a race-course.), having no reason in
19677 them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?
19678 
19679 Certainly not.
19680 
19681 Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as
19682 will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering
19683 questions?
19684 
19685 Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.
19686 
19687 Dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences,
19688 and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher--the nature
19689 of knowledge can no further go?
19690 
19691 I agree, he said.
19692 
19693 But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to
19694 be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered.
19695 
19696 Yes, clearly.
19697 
19698 You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?
19699 
19700 Certainly, he said.
19701 
19702 The same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given
19703 to the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and,
19704 having noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural
19705 gifts which will facilitate their education.
19706 
19707 And what are these?
19708 
19709 Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind
19710 more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of
19711 gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not shared
19712 with the body.
19713 
19714 Very true, he replied.
19715 
19716 Further, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and be
19717 an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will
19718 never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go
19719 through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of
19720 him.
19721 
19722 Certainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.
19723 
19724 The mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no
19725 vocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she has
19726 fallen into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and not
19727 bastards.
19728 
19729 What do you mean?
19730 
19731 In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting
19732 industry--I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle:
19733 as, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all
19734 other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour
19735 of learning or listening or enquiring. Or the occupation to which he
19736 devotes himself may be of an opposite kind, and he may have the other
19737 sort of lameness.
19738 
19739 Certainly, he said.
19740 
19741 And as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and
19742 lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at
19743 herself and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary
19744 falsehood, and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire
19745 of ignorance, and has no shame at being detected?
19746 
19747 To be sure.
19748 
19749 And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every
19750 other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son
19751 and the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities
19752 states and individuals unconsciously err; and the state makes a ruler,
19753 and the individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part of
19754 virtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard.
19755 
19756 That is very true, he said.
19757 
19758 All these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us; and
19759 if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and
19760 training are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing
19761 to say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and
19762 of the State; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse
19763 will happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on
19764 philosophy than she has to endure at present.
19765 
19766 That would not be creditable.
19767 
19768 Certainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into
19769 earnest I am equally ridiculous.
19770 
19771 In what respect?
19772 
19773 I had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too
19774 much excitement. For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled
19775 under foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the
19776 authors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.
19777 
19778 Indeed! I was listening, and did not think so.
19779 
19780 But I, who am the speaker, felt that I was. And now let me remind you
19781 that, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do
19782 so in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he
19783 grows old may learn many things--for he can no more learn much than he
19784 can run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.
19785 
19786 Of course.
19787 
19788 And, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of
19789 instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented
19790 to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our
19791 system of education.
19792 
19793 Why not?
19794 
19795 Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of
19796 knowledge of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm
19797 to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no
19798 hold on the mind.
19799 
19800 Very true.
19801 
19802 Then, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but let early
19803 education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find
19804 out the natural bent.
19805 
19806 That is a very rational notion, he said.
19807 
19808 Do you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the
19809 battle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be
19810 brought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given
19811 them?
19812 
19813 Yes, I remember.
19814 
19815 The same practice may be followed, I said, in all these things--labours,
19816 lessons, dangers--and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be
19817 enrolled in a select number.
19818 
19819 At what age?
19820 
19821 At the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether of
19822 two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for
19823 any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning;
19824 and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most
19825 important tests to which our youth are subjected.
19826 
19827 Certainly, he replied.
19828 
19829 After that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years
19830 old will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they
19831 learned without any order in their early education will now be brought
19832 together, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them
19833 to one another and to true being.
19834 
19835 Yes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting
19836 root.
19837 
19838 Yes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion
19839 of dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical.
19840 
19841 I agree with you, he said.
19842 
19843 These, I said, are the points which you must consider; and those who
19844 have most of this comprehension, and who are most steadfast in their
19845 learning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they
19846 have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the
19847 select class, and elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove
19848 them by the help of dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able
19849 to give up the use of sight and the other senses, and in company with
19850 truth to attain absolute being: And here, my friend, great caution is
19851 required.
19852 
19853 Why great caution?
19854 
19855 Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has
19856 introduced?
19857 
19858 What evil? he said.
19859 
19860 The students of the art are filled with lawlessness.
19861 
19862 Quite true, he said.
19863 
19864 Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in
19865 their case? or will you make allowance for them?
19866 
19867 In what way make allowance?
19868 
19869 I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son
19870 who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous
19871 family, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he learns
19872 that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he
19873 is unable to discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave
19874 towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the
19875 period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he
19876 knows? Or shall I guess for you?
19877 
19878 If you please.
19879 
19880 Then I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be
19881 likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations
19882 more than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when
19883 in need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less
19884 willing to disobey them in any important matter.
19885 
19886 He will.
19887 
19888 But when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would
19889 diminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted
19890 to the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he
19891 would now live after their ways, and openly associate with them, and,
19892 unless he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble
19893 himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations.
19894 
19895 Well, all that is very probable. But how is the image applicable to the
19896 disciples of philosophy?
19897 
19898 In this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice
19899 and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental
19900 authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.
19901 
19902 That is true.
19903 
19904 There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and
19905 attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense of
19906 right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers.
19907 
19908 True.
19909 
19910 Now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what
19911 is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him,
19912 and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven
19913 into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable,
19914 or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of all the notions
19915 which he most valued, do you think that he will still honour and obey
19916 them as before?
19917 
19918 Impossible.
19919 
19920 And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore,
19921 and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any life
19922 other than that which flatters his desires?
19923 
19924 He cannot.
19925 
19926 And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?
19927 
19928 Unquestionably.
19929 
19930 Now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have
19931 described, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.
19932 
19933 Yes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.
19934 
19935 Therefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our
19936 citizens who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in
19937 introducing them to dialectic.
19938 
19939 Certainly.
19940 
19941 There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early; for
19942 youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste
19943 in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and
19944 refuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs,
19945 they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.
19946 
19947 Yes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.
19948 
19949 And when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the hands
19950 of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing
19951 anything which they believed before, and hence, not only they, but
19952 philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the
19953 rest of the world.
19954 
19955 Too true, he said.
19956 
19957 But when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such
19958 insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth, and
19959 not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement; and the
19960 greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing
19961 the honour of the pursuit.
19962 
19963 Very true, he said.
19964 
19965 And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the
19966 disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now,
19967 any chance aspirant or intruder?
19968 
19969 Very true.
19970 
19971 Suppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics
19972 and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice
19973 the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise--will that be
19974 enough?
19975 
19976 Would you say six or four years? he asked.
19977 
19978 Say five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be sent down
19979 again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office
19980 which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get their
19981 experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying whether,
19982 when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they will stand
19983 firm or flinch.
19984 
19985 And how long is this stage of their lives to last?
19986 
19987 Fifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of
19988 age, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves
19989 in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at
19990 last to their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must
19991 raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all
19992 things, and behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according
19993 to which they are to order the State and the lives of individuals, and
19994 the remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief
19995 pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and ruling
19996 for the public good, not as though they were performing some heroic
19997 action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they have brought up in
19998 each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to
19999 be governors of the State, then they will depart to the Islands of the
20000 Blest and dwell there; and the city will give them public memorials and
20001 sacrifices and honour them, if the Pythian oracle consent, as demigods,
20002 but if not, as in any case blessed and divine.
20003 
20004 You are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our governors
20005 faultless in beauty.
20006 
20007 Yes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not
20008 suppose that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to
20009 women as far as their natures can go.
20010 
20011 There you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in all
20012 things like the men.
20013 
20014 Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has
20015 been said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and
20016 although difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which
20017 has been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are
20018 born in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this
20019 present world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all
20020 things right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding
20021 justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose
20022 ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when
20023 they set in order their own city?
20024 
20025 How will they proceed?
20026 
20027 They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of
20028 the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of
20029 their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents;
20030 these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws
20031 which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of
20032 which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness,
20033 and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
20034 
20035 Yes, that will be the best way. And I think, Socrates, that you have
20036 very well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into
20037 being.
20038 
20039 Enough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its
20040 image--there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.
20041 
20042 There is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in thinking
20043 that nothing more need be said.
20044 
20045 
20046 
20047 
20048 BOOK VIII.
20049 
20050 And so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect
20051 State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education
20052 and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best
20053 philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?
20054 
20055 That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.
20056 
20057 Yes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when
20058 appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses
20059 such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing
20060 private, or individual; and about their property, you remember what we
20061 agreed?
20062 
20063 Yes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions
20064 of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving
20065 from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their
20066 maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole
20067 State.
20068 
20069 True, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, let
20070 us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the old
20071 path.
20072 
20073 There is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that you
20074 had finished the description of the State: you said that such a State
20075 was good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although, as now
20076 appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of State and man.
20077 And you said further, that if this was the true form, then the others
20078 were false; and of the false forms, you said, as I remember, that there
20079 were four principal ones, and that their defects, and the defects of
20080 the individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining. When we had
20081 seen all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was the best and
20082 who was the worst of them, we were to consider whether the best was not
20083 also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable. I asked you
20084 what were the four forms of government of which you spoke, and then
20085 Polemarchus and Adeimantus put in their word; and you began again, and
20086 have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived.
20087 
20088 Your recollection, I said, is most exact.
20089 
20090 Then, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in the
20091 same position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me the
20092 same answer which you were about to give me then.
20093 
20094 Yes, if I can, I will, I said.
20095 
20096 I shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of
20097 which you were speaking.
20098 
20099 That question, I said, is easily answered: the four governments of which
20100 I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of Crete
20101 and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy
20102 comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of government
20103 which teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows
20104 oligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny, great
20105 and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and worst
20106 disorder of a State. I do not know, do you? of any other constitution
20107 which can be said to have a distinct character. There are lordships and
20108 principalities which are bought and sold, and some other intermediate
20109 forms of government. But these are nondescripts and may be found equally
20110 among Hellenes and among barbarians.
20111 
20112 Yes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government
20113 which exist among them.
20114 
20115 Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men
20116 vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the
20117 other? For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,' and
20118 not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure
20119 turn the scale and draw other things after them?
20120 
20121 Yes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human
20122 characters.
20123 
20124 Then if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions of
20125 individual minds will also be five?
20126 
20127 Certainly.
20128 
20129 Him who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly call just and good,
20130 we have already described.
20131 
20132 We have.
20133 
20134 Then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being
20135 the contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity; also
20136 the oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical. Let us place the most
20137 just by the side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be
20138 able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads
20139 a life of pure justice or pure injustice. The enquiry will then be
20140 completed. And we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice,
20141 as Thrasymachus advises, or in accordance with the conclusions of the
20142 argument to prefer justice.
20143 
20144 Certainly, he replied, we must do as you say.
20145 
20146 Shall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to clearness,
20147 of taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual, and
20148 begin with the government of honour?--I know of no name for such a
20149 government other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We will compare
20150 with this the like character in the individual; and, after that,
20151 consider oligarchy and the oligarchical man; and then again we will turn
20152 our attention to democracy and the democratical man; and lastly, we
20153 will go and view the city of tyranny, and once more take a look into the
20154 tyrant's soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision.
20155 
20156 That way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable.
20157 
20158 First, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government of
20159 honour) arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best). Clearly,
20160 all political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing
20161 power; a government which is united, however small, cannot be moved.
20162 
20163 Very true, he said.
20164 
20165 In what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner will the
20166 two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with
20167 one another? Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell
20168 us 'how discord first arose'? Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery,
20169 to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a
20170 lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?
20171 
20172 How would they address us?
20173 
20174 After this manner:--A city which is thus constituted can hardly be
20175 shaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an
20176 end, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will
20177 in time be dissolved. And this is the dissolution:--In plants that grow
20178 in the earth, as well as in animals that move on the earth's surface,
20179 fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences
20180 of the circles of each are completed, which in short-lived existences
20181 pass over a short space, and in long-lived ones over a long space. But
20182 to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and
20183 education of your rulers will not attain; the laws which regulate them
20184 will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense,
20185 but will escape them, and they will bring children into the world when
20186 they ought not. Now that which is of divine birth has a period which is
20187 contained in a perfect number (i.e. a cyclical number, such as 6, which
20188 is equal to the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 3, so that when the circle
20189 or time represented by 6 is completed, the lesser times or rotations
20190 represented by 1, 2, 3 are also completed.), but the period of
20191 human birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments
20192 by involution and evolution (or squared and cubed) obtaining three
20193 intervals and four terms of like and unlike, waxing and waning numbers,
20194 make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another. (Probably
20195 the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 of which the three first = the sides of the
20196 Pythagorean triangle. The terms will then be 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed,
20197 which together = 6 cubed = 216.) The base of these (3) with a third
20198 added (4) when combined with five (20) and raised to the third power
20199 furnishes two harmonies; the first a square which is a hundred times
20200 as great (400 = 4 x 100) (Or the first a square which is 100 x 100 =
20201 10,000. The whole number will then be 17,500 = a square of 100, and an
20202 oblong of 100 by 75.), and the other a figure having one side equal to
20203 the former, but oblong, consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon
20204 rational diameters of a square (i.e. omitting fractions), the side of
20205 which is five (7 x 7 = 49 x 100 = 4900), each of them being less by one
20206 (than the perfect square which includes the fractions, sc. 50) or less
20207 by (Or, 'consisting of two numbers squared upon irrational diameters,'
20208 etc. = 100. For other explanations of the passage see Introduction.) two
20209 perfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square the side of which
20210 is five = 50 + 50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of three (27 x 100 = 2700
20211 + 4900 + 400 = 8000). Now this number represents a geometrical figure
20212 which has control over the good and evil of births. For when your
20213 guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and
20214 bridegroom out of season, the children will not be goodly or
20215 fortunate. And though only the best of them will be appointed by their
20216 predecessors, still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places,
20217 and when they come into power as guardians, they will soon be found
20218 to fail in taking care of us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music;
20219 which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of
20220 your State will be less cultivated. In the succeeding generation rulers
20221 will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal
20222 of your different races, which, like Hesiod's, are of gold and silver
20223 and brass and iron. And so iron will be mingled with silver, and brass
20224 with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and
20225 irregularity, which always and in all places are causes of hatred
20226 and war. This the Muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has
20227 sprung, wherever arising; and this is their answer to us.
20228 
20229 Yes, and we may assume that they answer truly.
20230 
20231 Why, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak
20232 falsely?
20233 
20234 And what do the Muses say next?
20235 
20236 When discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the
20237 iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and
20238 silver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the
20239 true riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient
20240 order of things. There was a battle between them, and at last they
20241 agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual owners;
20242 and they enslaved their friends and maintainers, whom they had formerly
20243 protected in the condition of freemen, and made of them subjects and
20244 servants; and they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch
20245 against them.
20246 
20247 I believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change.
20248 
20249 And the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate
20250 between oligarchy and aristocracy?
20251 
20252 Very true.
20253 
20254 Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will
20255 they proceed? Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy
20256 and the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other, and
20257 will also have some peculiarities.
20258 
20259 True, he said.
20260 
20261 In the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class
20262 from agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution
20263 of common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military
20264 training--in all these respects this State will resemble the former.
20265 
20266 True.
20267 
20268 But in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are no
20269 longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;
20270 and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who
20271 are by nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set
20272 by them upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of
20273 everlasting wars--this State will be for the most part peculiar.
20274 
20275 Yes.
20276 
20277 Yes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like those
20278 who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing after
20279 gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having magazines
20280 and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them;
20281 also castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in which they will
20282 spend large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they please.
20283 
20284 That is most true, he said.
20285 
20286 And they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the
20287 money which they prize; they will spend that which is another man's on
20288 the gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and running
20289 away like children from the law, their father: they have been schooled
20290 not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her
20291 who is the true Muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and have
20292 honoured gymnastic more than music.
20293 
20294 Undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a
20295 mixture of good and evil.
20296 
20297 Why, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing only, is
20298 predominantly seen,--the spirit of contention and ambition; and these
20299 are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.
20300 
20301 Assuredly, he said.
20302 
20303 Such is the origin and such the character of this State, which has been
20304 described in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required,
20305 for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and
20306 most perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and all the
20307 characters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable
20308 labour.
20309 
20310 Very true, he replied.
20311 
20312 Now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into
20313 being, and what is he like?
20314 
20315 I think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which
20316 characterises him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.
20317 
20318 Perhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are
20319 other respects in which he is very different.
20320 
20321 In what respects?
20322 
20323 He should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet
20324 a friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.
20325 Such a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man,
20326 who is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen, and
20327 remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a lover of
20328 honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or on any
20329 ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has performed feats
20330 of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase.
20331 
20332 Yes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.
20333 
20334 Such an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets
20335 older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a
20336 piece of the avaricious nature in him, and is not single-minded towards
20337 virtue, having lost his best guardian.
20338 
20339 Who was that? said Adeimantus.
20340 
20341 Philosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes up her
20342 abode in a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.
20343 
20344 Good, he said.
20345 
20346 Such, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the timocratical
20347 State.
20348 
20349 Exactly.
20350 
20351 His origin is as follows:--He is often the young son of a brave father,
20352 who dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours
20353 and offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but is
20354 ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.
20355 
20356 And how does the son come into being?
20357 
20358 The character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother
20359 complaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which
20360 the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women.
20361 Further, when she sees her husband not very eager about money, and
20362 instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking
20363 whatever happens to him quietly; and when she observes that his thoughts
20364 always centre in himself, while he treats her with very considerable
20365 indifference, she is annoyed, and says to her son that his father is
20366 only half a man and far too easy-going: adding all the other complaints
20367 about her own ill-treatment which women are so fond of rehearsing.
20368 
20369 Yes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints
20370 are so like themselves.
20371 
20372 And you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed to
20373 be attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same
20374 strain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his father,
20375 or is wronging him in any way, and he fails to prosecute them, they tell
20376 the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this
20377 sort, and be more of a man than his father. He has only to walk abroad
20378 and he hears and sees the same sort of thing: those who do their own
20379 business in the city are called simpletons, and held in no esteem, while
20380 the busy-bodies are honoured and applauded. The result is that the young
20381 man, hearing and seeing all these things--hearing, too, the words of
20382 his father, and having a nearer view of his way of life, and making
20383 comparisons of him and others--is drawn opposite ways: while his father
20384 is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul, the
20385 others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive; and he being not
20386 originally of a bad nature, but having kept bad company, is at last
20387 brought by their joint influence to a middle point, and gives up the
20388 kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness
20389 and passion, and becomes arrogant and ambitious.
20390 
20391 You seem to me to have described his origin perfectly.
20392 
20393 Then we have now, I said, the second form of government and the second
20394 type of character?
20395 
20396 We have.
20397 
20398 Next, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus says,
20399 
20400 'Is set over against another State;'
20401 
20402 or rather, as our plan requires, begin with the State.
20403 
20404 By all means.
20405 
20406 I believe that oligarchy follows next in order.
20407 
20408 And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?
20409 
20410 A government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have
20411 power and the poor man is deprived of it.
20412 
20413 I understand, he replied.
20414 
20415 Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to
20416 oligarchy arises?
20417 
20418 Yes.
20419 
20420 Well, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes
20421 into the other.
20422 
20423 How?
20424 
20425 The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the
20426 ruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do
20427 they or their wives care about the law?
20428 
20429 Yes, indeed.
20430 
20431 And then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and thus the
20432 great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.
20433 
20434 Likely enough.
20435 
20436 And so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making
20437 a fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are
20438 placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as
20439 the other falls.
20440 
20441 True.
20442 
20443 And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State,
20444 virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured.
20445 
20446 Clearly.
20447 
20448 And what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is
20449 neglected.
20450 
20451 That is obvious.
20452 
20453 And so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become
20454 lovers of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and
20455 make a ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.
20456 
20457 They do so.
20458 
20459 They next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the
20460 qualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower
20461 in another, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow
20462 no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in
20463 the government. These changes in the constitution they effect by force
20464 of arms, if intimidation has not already done their work.
20465 
20466 Very true.
20467 
20468 And this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is
20469 established.
20470 
20471 Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of
20472 government, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?
20473 
20474 First of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification. Just
20475 think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their
20476 property, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though
20477 he were a better pilot?
20478 
20479 You mean that they would shipwreck?
20480 
20481 Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?
20482 
20483 I should imagine so.
20484 
20485 Except a city?--or would you include a city?
20486 
20487 Nay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch as
20488 the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.
20489 
20490 This, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?
20491 
20492 Clearly.
20493 
20494 And here is another defect which is quite as bad.
20495 
20496 What defect?
20497 
20498 The inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States, the
20499 one of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same spot
20500 and always conspiring against one another.
20501 
20502 That, surely, is at least as bad.
20503 
20504 Another discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are
20505 incapable of carrying on any war. Either they arm the multitude, and
20506 then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not
20507 call them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to
20508 fight as they are few to rule. And at the same time their fondness for
20509 money makes them unwilling to pay taxes.
20510 
20511 How discreditable!
20512 
20513 And, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons have
20514 too many callings--they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in one.
20515 Does that look well?
20516 
20517 Anything but well.
20518 
20519 There is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and to
20520 which this State first begins to be liable.
20521 
20522 What evil?
20523 
20524 A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property;
20525 yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a
20526 part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but
20527 only a poor, helpless creature.
20528 
20529 Yes, that is an evil which also first begins in this State.
20530 
20531 The evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both the
20532 extremes of great wealth and utter poverty.
20533 
20534 True.
20535 
20536 But think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money,
20537 was a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes
20538 of citizenship? Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling
20539 body, although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a
20540 spendthrift?
20541 
20542 As you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.
20543 
20544 May we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone
20545 in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as the
20546 other is of the hive?
20547 
20548 Just so, Socrates.
20549 
20550 And God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings,
20551 whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others
20552 have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in their old
20553 age end as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal class, as they
20554 are termed.
20555 
20556 Most true, he said.
20557 
20558 Clearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in that
20559 neighborhood there are hidden away thieves, and cut-purses and robbers
20560 of temples, and all sorts of malefactors.
20561 
20562 Clearly.
20563 
20564 Well, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers?
20565 
20566 Yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.
20567 
20568 And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to
20569 be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are
20570 careful to restrain by force?
20571 
20572 Certainly, we may be so bold.
20573 
20574 The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,
20575 ill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?
20576 
20577 True.
20578 
20579 Such, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there
20580 may be many other evils.
20581 
20582 Very likely.
20583 
20584 Then oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are
20585 elected for their wealth, may now be dismissed. Let us next proceed to
20586 consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this
20587 State.
20588 
20589 By all means.
20590 
20591 Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?
20592 
20593 How?
20594 
20595 A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first
20596 he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but
20597 presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State as upon
20598 a sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been
20599 a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a
20600 prejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or
20601 deprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken from
20602 him.
20603 
20604 Nothing more likely.
20605 
20606 And the son has seen and known all this--he is a ruined man, and his
20607 fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his
20608 bosom's throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean
20609 and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. Is not such
20610 an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the
20611 vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt
20612 with tiara and chain and scimitar?
20613 
20614 Most true, he replied.
20615 
20616 And when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently
20617 on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know their place,
20618 he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into
20619 larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything
20620 but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so much as the
20621 acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.
20622 
20623 Of all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the
20624 conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.
20625 
20626 And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?
20627 
20628 Yes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the
20629 State out of which oligarchy came.
20630 
20631 Let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.
20632 
20633 Very good.
20634 
20635 First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon
20636 wealth?
20637 
20638 Certainly.
20639 
20640 Also in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only
20641 satisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to them;
20642 his other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are unprofitable.
20643 
20644 True.
20645 
20646 He is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes a
20647 purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud.
20648 Is he not a true image of the State which he represents?
20649 
20650 He appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him as
20651 well as by the State.
20652 
20653 You see that he is not a man of cultivation, I said.
20654 
20655 I imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made a
20656 blind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour.
20657 
20658 Excellent! I said. Yet consider: Must we not further admit that owing to
20659 this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as
20660 of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general habit
20661 of life?
20662 
20663 True.
20664 
20665 Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his
20666 rogueries?
20667 
20668 Where must I look?
20669 
20670 You should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting
20671 dishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.
20672 
20673 Aye.
20674 
20675 It will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give
20676 him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced
20677 virtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by
20678 reason, but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he
20679 trembles for his possessions.
20680 
20681 To be sure.
20682 
20683 Yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires
20684 of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend
20685 what is not his own.
20686 
20687 Yes, and they will be strong in him too.
20688 
20689 The man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and not
20690 one; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail over
20691 his inferior ones.
20692 
20693 True.
20694 
20695 For these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people;
20696 yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far
20697 away and never come near him.
20698 
20699 I should expect so.
20700 
20701 And surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a
20702 State for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition;
20703 he will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he of
20704 awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in
20705 the struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part
20706 only of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses the
20707 prize and saves his money.
20708 
20709 Very true.
20710 
20711 Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers to
20712 the oligarchical State?
20713 
20714 There can be no doubt.
20715 
20716 Next comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to
20717 be considered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the
20718 democratic man, and bring him up for judgment.
20719 
20720 That, he said, is our method.
20721 
20722 Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy
20723 arise? Is it not on this wise?--The good at which such a State aims is
20724 to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?
20725 
20726 What then?
20727 
20728 The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse
20729 to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because
20730 they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their
20731 estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?
20732 
20733 To be sure.
20734 
20735 There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of
20736 moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any
20737 considerable extent; one or the other will be disregarded.
20738 
20739 That is tolerably clear.
20740 
20741 And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness and
20742 extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?
20743 
20744 Yes, often.
20745 
20746 And still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and
20747 fully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their
20748 citizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate
20749 and conspire against those who have got their property, and against
20750 everybody else, and are eager for revolution.
20751 
20752 That is true.
20753 
20754 On the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and
20755 pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert
20756 their sting--that is, their money--into some one else who is not on
20757 his guard against them, and recover the parent sum many times over
20758 multiplied into a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper
20759 to abound in the State.
20760 
20761 Yes, he said, there are plenty of them--that is certain.
20762 
20763 The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either
20764 by restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another remedy:
20765 
20766 What other?
20767 
20768 One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the
20769 citizens to look to their characters:--Let there be a general rule that
20770 every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and
20771 there will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of
20772 which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.
20773 
20774 Yes, they will be greatly lessened.
20775 
20776 At present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named,
20777 treat their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially
20778 the young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life
20779 of luxury and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are
20780 incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain.
20781 
20782 Very true.
20783 
20784 They themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent as
20785 the pauper to the cultivation of virtue.
20786 
20787 Yes, quite as indifferent.
20788 
20789 Such is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often rulers
20790 and their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on a journey
20791 or on some other occasion of meeting, on a pilgrimage or a march,
20792 as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye and they may observe the
20793 behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger--for where danger
20794 is, there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich--and
20795 very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the
20796 side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has
20797 plenty of superfluous flesh--when he sees such an one puffing and at his
20798 wits'-end, how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are
20799 only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them? And when they
20800 meet in private will not people be saying to one another 'Our warriors
20801 are not good for much'?
20802 
20803 Yes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of talking.
20804 
20805 And, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without
20806 may bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external
20807 provocation a commotion may arise within--in the same way wherever there
20808 is weakness in the State there is also likely to be illness, of which
20809 the occasion may be very slight, the one party introducing from without
20810 their oligarchical, the other their democratical allies, and then
20811 the State falls sick, and is at war with herself; and may be at times
20812 distracted, even when there is no external cause.
20813 
20814 Yes, surely.
20815 
20816 And then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their
20817 opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder
20818 they give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of
20819 government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot.
20820 
20821 Yes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution
20822 has been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite party
20823 to withdraw.
20824 
20825 And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government have
20826 they? for as the government is, such will be the man.
20827 
20828 Clearly, he said.
20829 
20830 In the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of
20831 freedom and frankness--a man may say and do what he likes?
20832 
20833 'Tis said so, he replied.
20834 
20835 And where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for
20836 himself his own life as he pleases?
20837 
20838 Clearly.
20839 
20840 Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human
20841 natures?
20842 
20843 There will.
20844 
20845 This, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being like an
20846 embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower. And just
20847 as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things
20848 most charming, so there are many men to whom this State, which is
20849 spangled with the manners and characters of mankind, will appear to be
20850 the fairest of States.
20851 
20852 Yes.
20853 
20854 Yes, my good Sir, and there will be no better in which to look for a
20855 government.
20856 
20857 Why?
20858 
20859 Because of the liberty which reigns there--they have a complete
20860 assortment of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State,
20861 as we have been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at
20862 which they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when he
20863 has made his choice, he may found his State.
20864 
20865 He will be sure to have patterns enough.
20866 
20867 And there being no necessity, I said, for you to govern in this State,
20868 even if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like, or
20869 go to war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others are
20870 at peace, unless you are so disposed--there being no necessity also,
20871 because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast, that you
20872 should not hold office or be a dicast, if you have a fancy--is not this
20873 a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful?
20874 
20875 For the moment, yes.
20876 
20877 And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?
20878 Have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons, although they
20879 have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are and walk
20880 about the world--the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees or
20881 cares?
20882 
20883 Yes, he replied, many and many a one.
20884 
20885 See too, I said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't
20886 care' about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine
20887 principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city--as
20888 when we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted nature,
20889 there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used
20890 to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study--how
20891 grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet,
20892 never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and
20893 promoting to honour any one who professes to be the people's friend.
20894 
20895 Yes, she is of a noble spirit.
20896 
20897 These and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which
20898 is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and
20899 dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.
20900 
20901 We know her well.
20902 
20903 Consider now, I said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather
20904 consider, as in the case of the State, how he comes into being.
20905 
20906 Very good, he said.
20907 
20908 Is not this the way--he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical
20909 father who has trained him in his own habits?
20910 
20911 Exactly.
20912 
20913 And, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of
20914 the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are called
20915 unnecessary?
20916 
20917 Obviously.
20918 
20919 Would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are the
20920 necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?
20921 
20922 I should.
20923 
20924 Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of
20925 which the satisfaction is a benefit to us? And they are rightly called
20926 so, because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial
20927 and what is necessary, and cannot help it.
20928 
20929 True.
20930 
20931 We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?
20932 
20933 We are not.
20934 
20935 And the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from his
20936 youth upwards--of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and in
20937 some cases the reverse of good--shall we not be right in saying that all
20938 these are unnecessary?
20939 
20940 Yes, certainly.
20941 
20942 Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have a
20943 general notion of them?
20944 
20945 Very good.
20946 
20947 Will not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments,
20948 in so far as they are required for health and strength, be of the
20949 necessary class?
20950 
20951 That is what I should suppose.
20952 
20953 The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and it
20954 is essential to the continuance of life?
20955 
20956 Yes.
20957 
20958 But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for
20959 health?
20960 
20961 Certainly.
20962 
20963 And the desire which goes beyond this, of more delicate food, or other
20964 luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained
20965 in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the
20966 pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?
20967 
20968 Very true.
20969 
20970 May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money
20971 because they conduce to production?
20972 
20973 Certainly.
20974 
20975 And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds
20976 good?
20977 
20978 True.
20979 
20980 And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures
20981 and desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary desires,
20982 whereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and
20983 oligarchical?
20984 
20985 Very true.
20986 
20987 Again, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the
20988 oligarchical: the following, as I suspect, is commonly the process.
20989 
20990 What is the process?
20991 
20992 When a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing,
20993 in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and has come to
20994 associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for
20995 him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure--then, as you may
20996 imagine, the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him
20997 into the democratical?
20998 
20999 Inevitably.
21000 
21001 And as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected by
21002 an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so too
21003 the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without
21004 to assist the desires within him, that which is akin and alike again
21005 helping that which is akin and alike?
21006 
21007 Certainly.
21008 
21009 And if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within
21010 him, whether the influence of a father or of kindred, advising or
21011 rebuking him, then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite
21012 faction, and he goes to war with himself.
21013 
21014 It must be so.
21015 
21016 And there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the
21017 oligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished;
21018 a spirit of reverence enters into the young man's soul and order is
21019 restored.
21020 
21021 Yes, he said, that sometimes happens.
21022 
21023 And then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh ones
21024 spring up, which are akin to them, and because he their father does not
21025 know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.
21026 
21027 Yes, he said, that is apt to be the way.
21028 
21029 They draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse with
21030 them, breed and multiply in him.
21031 
21032 Very true.
21033 
21034 At length they seize upon the citadel of the young man's soul, which
21035 they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and
21036 true words, which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to
21037 the gods, and are their best guardians and sentinels.
21038 
21039 None better.
21040 
21041 False and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their
21042 place.
21043 
21044 They are certain to do so.
21045 
21046 And so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters, and
21047 takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help be
21048 sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain
21049 conceits shut the gate of the king's fastness; and they will neither
21050 allow the embassy itself to enter, nor if private advisers offer the
21051 fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them.
21052 There is a battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which
21053 they call silliness, is ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and
21054 temperance, which they nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the mire and
21055 cast forth; they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure
21056 are vulgarity and meanness, and so, by the help of a rabble of evil
21057 appetites, they drive them beyond the border.
21058 
21059 Yes, with a will.
21060 
21061 And when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now in
21062 their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries, the
21063 next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and
21064 waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads, and
21065 a great company with them, hymning their praises and calling them by
21066 sweet names; insolence they term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and
21067 waste magnificence, and impudence courage. And so the young man
21068 passes out of his original nature, which was trained in the school of
21069 necessity, into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary
21070 pleasures.
21071 
21072 Yes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.
21073 
21074 After this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on
21075 unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones; but if he be
21076 fortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years have
21077 elapsed, and the heyday of passion is over--supposing that he then
21078 re-admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues, and does not
21079 wholly give himself up to their successors--in that case he balances his
21080 pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium, putting the government of
21081 himself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn;
21082 and when he has had enough of that, then into the hands of another; he
21083 despises none of them but encourages them all equally.
21084 
21085 Very true, he said.
21086 
21087 Neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of
21088 advice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions
21089 of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and that he ought
21090 to use and honour some and chastise and master the others--whenever this
21091 is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike,
21092 and that one is as good as another.
21093 
21094 Yes, he said; that is the way with him.
21095 
21096 Yes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the
21097 hour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute; then
21098 he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a turn
21099 at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once
21100 more living the life of a philosopher; often he is busy with politics,
21101 and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head;
21102 and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is in that
21103 direction, or of men of business, once more in that. His life has
21104 neither law nor order; and this distracted existence he terms joy and
21105 bliss and freedom; and so he goes on.
21106 
21107 Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.
21108 
21109 Yes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the
21110 lives of many;--he answers to the State which we described as fair
21111 and spangled. And many a man and many a woman will take him for their
21112 pattern, and many a constitution and many an example of manners is
21113 contained in him.
21114 
21115 Just so.
21116 
21117 Let him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called the
21118 democratic man.
21119 
21120 Let that be his place, he said.
21121 
21122 Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike,
21123 tyranny and the tyrant; these we have now to consider.
21124 
21125 Quite true, he said.
21126 
21127 Say then, my friend, In what manner does tyranny arise?--that it has a
21128 democratic origin is evident.
21129 
21130 Clearly.
21131 
21132 And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as
21133 democracy from oligarchy--I mean, after a sort?
21134 
21135 How?
21136 
21137 The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it
21138 was maintained was excess of wealth--am I not right?
21139 
21140 Yes.
21141 
21142 And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things
21143 for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?
21144 
21145 True.
21146 
21147 And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings
21148 her to dissolution?
21149 
21150 What good?
21151 
21152 Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the glory
21153 of the State--and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman
21154 of nature deign to dwell.
21155 
21156 Yes; the saying is in every body's mouth.
21157 
21158 I was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the
21159 neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which
21160 occasions a demand for tyranny.
21161 
21162 How so?
21163 
21164 When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cup-bearers
21165 presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of
21166 freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful
21167 draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they
21168 are cursed oligarchs.
21169 
21170 Yes, he replied, a very common occurrence.
21171 
21172 Yes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who
21173 hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are like
21174 rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her own
21175 heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public. Now, in
21176 such a State, can liberty have any limit?
21177 
21178 Certainly not.
21179 
21180 By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by
21181 getting among the animals and infecting them.
21182 
21183 How do you mean?
21184 
21185 I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his
21186 sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he
21187 having no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is
21188 his freedom, and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen
21189 with the metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either.
21190 
21191 Yes, he said, that is the way.
21192 
21193 And these are not the only evils, I said--there are several lesser ones:
21194 In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars,
21195 and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are
21196 all alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready
21197 to compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the
21198 young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be thought
21199 morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners of the
21200 young.
21201 
21202 Quite true, he said.
21203 
21204 The last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money,
21205 whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser; nor
21206 must I forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in
21207 relation to each other.
21208 
21209 Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?
21210 
21211 That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who
21212 does not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the
21213 animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in
21214 any other State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as
21215 good as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of
21216 marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they
21217 will run at any body who comes in their way if he does not leave
21218 the road clear for them: and all things are just ready to burst with
21219 liberty.
21220 
21221 When I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you
21222 describe. You and I have dreamed the same thing.
21223 
21224 And above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive the
21225 citizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority,
21226 and at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the laws,
21227 written or unwritten; they will have no one over them.
21228 
21229 Yes, he said, I know it too well.
21230 
21231 Such, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of which
21232 springs tyranny.
21233 
21234 Glorious indeed, he said. But what is the next step?
21235 
21236 The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease
21237 magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy--the truth
21238 being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in
21239 the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and
21240 in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.
21241 
21242 True.
21243 
21244 The excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems only to
21245 pass into excess of slavery.
21246 
21247 Yes, the natural order.
21248 
21249 And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most
21250 aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of
21251 liberty?
21252 
21253 As we might expect.
21254 
21255 That, however, was not, as I believe, your question--you rather desired
21256 to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and
21257 democracy, and is the ruin of both?
21258 
21259 Just so, he replied.
21260 
21261 Well, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts,
21262 of whom the more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the
21263 followers, the same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless,
21264 and others having stings.
21265 
21266 A very just comparison.
21267 
21268 These two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are
21269 generated, being what phlegm and bile are to the body. And the good
21270 physician and lawgiver of the State ought, like the wise bee-master, to
21271 keep them at a distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming in;
21272 and if they have anyhow found a way in, then he should have them and
21273 their cells cut out as speedily as possible.
21274 
21275 Yes, by all means, he said.
21276 
21277 Then, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us imagine
21278 democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes; for in the
21279 first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than
21280 there were in the oligarchical State.
21281 
21282 That is true.
21283 
21284 And in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.
21285 
21286 How so?
21287 
21288 Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven from
21289 office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in a
21290 democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener
21291 sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not
21292 suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost
21293 everything is managed by the drones.
21294 
21295 Very true, he said.
21296 
21297 Then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass.
21298 
21299 What is that?
21300 
21301 They are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders is sure to be
21302 the richest.
21303 
21304 Naturally so.
21305 
21306 They are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of
21307 honey to the drones.
21308 
21309 Why, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who have
21310 little.
21311 
21312 And this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon them.
21313 
21314 That is pretty much the case, he said.
21315 
21316 The people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their
21317 own hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon.
21318 This, when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a
21319 democracy.
21320 
21321 True, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate
21322 unless they get a little honey.
21323 
21324 And do they not share? I said. Do not their leaders deprive the rich
21325 of their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time
21326 taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?
21327 
21328 Why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.
21329 
21330 And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to
21331 defend themselves before the people as they best can?
21332 
21333 What else can they do?
21334 
21335 And then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge
21336 them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?
21337 
21338 True.
21339 
21340 And the end is that when they see the people, not of their own accord,
21341 but through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers,
21342 seeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become
21343 oligarchs in reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the
21344 drones torments them and breeds revolution in them.
21345 
21346 That is exactly the truth.
21347 
21348 Then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another.
21349 
21350 True.
21351 
21352 The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse
21353 into greatness.
21354 
21355 Yes, that is their way.
21356 
21357 This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first
21358 appears above ground he is a protector.
21359 
21360 Yes, that is quite clear.
21361 
21362 How then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? Clearly when
21363 he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple of
21364 Lycaean Zeus.
21365 
21366 What tale?
21367 
21368 The tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim
21369 minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a
21370 wolf. Did you never hear it?
21371 
21372 Oh, yes.
21373 
21374 And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at
21375 his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen;
21376 by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court
21377 and murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy
21378 tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens; some he kills
21379 and others he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of
21380 debts and partition of lands: and after this, what will be his destiny?
21381 Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a
21382 man become a wolf--that is, a tyrant?
21383 
21384 Inevitably.
21385 
21386 This, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the rich?
21387 
21388 The same.
21389 
21390 After a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his enemies,
21391 a tyrant full grown.
21392 
21393 That is clear.
21394 
21395 And if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death by
21396 a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.
21397 
21398 Yes, he said, that is their usual way.
21399 
21400 Then comes the famous request for a body-guard, which is the device of
21401 all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career--'Let not the
21402 people's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.'
21403 
21404 Exactly.
21405 
21406 The people readily assent; all their fears are for him--they have none
21407 for themselves.
21408 
21409 Very true.
21410 
21411 And when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of
21412 the people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to Croesus,
21413 
21414 'By pebbly Hermus' shore he flees and rests not, and is not ashamed to
21415 be a coward.'
21416 
21417 And quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be ashamed
21418 again.
21419 
21420 But if he is caught he dies.
21421 
21422 Of course.
21423 
21424 And he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not 'larding the
21425 plain' with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing up
21426 in the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer protector,
21427 but tyrant absolute.
21428 
21429 No doubt, he said.
21430 
21431 And now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the State
21432 in which a creature like him is generated.
21433 
21434 Yes, he said, let us consider that.
21435 
21436 At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and
21437 he salutes every one whom he meets;--he to be called a tyrant, who is
21438 making promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and
21439 distributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so
21440 kind and good to every one!
21441 
21442 Of course, he said.
21443 
21444 But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and
21445 there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some
21446 war or other, in order that the people may require a leader.
21447 
21448 To be sure.
21449 
21450 Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished
21451 by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their
21452 daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?
21453 
21454 Clearly.
21455 
21456 And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom,
21457 and of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for
21458 destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all
21459 these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war.
21460 
21461 He must.
21462 
21463 Now he begins to grow unpopular.
21464 
21465 A necessary result.
21466 
21467 Then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,
21468 speak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of
21469 them cast in his teeth what is being done.
21470 
21471 Yes, that may be expected.
21472 
21473 And the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot
21474 stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.
21475 
21476 He cannot.
21477 
21478 And therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is
21479 high-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy
21480 of them all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no,
21481 until he has made a purgation of the State.
21482 
21483 Yes, he said, and a rare purgation.
21484 
21485 Yes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the
21486 body; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he
21487 does the reverse.
21488 
21489 If he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help himself.
21490 
21491 What a blessed alternative, I said:--to be compelled to dwell only with
21492 the many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at all!
21493 
21494 Yes, that is the alternative.
21495 
21496 And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more
21497 satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?
21498 
21499 Certainly.
21500 
21501 And who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?
21502 
21503 They will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if he pays them.
21504 
21505 By the dog! I said, here are more drones, of every sort and from every
21506 land.
21507 
21508 Yes, he said, there are.
21509 
21510 But will he not desire to get them on the spot?
21511 
21512 How do you mean?
21513 
21514 He will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free and
21515 enrol them in his body-guard.
21516 
21517 To be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of all.
21518 
21519 What a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he has put to
21520 death the others and has these for his trusted friends.
21521 
21522 Yes, he said; they are quite of his sort.
21523 
21524 Yes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into
21525 existence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate
21526 and avoid him.
21527 
21528 Of course.
21529 
21530 Verily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great tragedian.
21531 
21532 Why so?
21533 
21534 Why, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,
21535 
21536 'Tyrants are wise by living with the wise;'
21537 
21538 and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes
21539 his companions.
21540 
21541 Yes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many other
21542 things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets.
21543 
21544 And therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us
21545 and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into
21546 our State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.
21547 
21548 Yes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us.
21549 
21550 But they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and
21551 hire voices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over to
21552 tyrannies and democracies.
21553 
21554 Very true.
21555 
21556 Moreover, they are paid for this and receive honour--the greatest
21557 honour, as might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest from
21558 democracies; but the higher they ascend our constitution hill, the more
21559 their reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to
21560 proceed further.
21561 
21562 True.
21563 
21564 But we are wandering from the subject: Let us therefore return and
21565 enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various
21566 and ever-changing army of his.
21567 
21568 If, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate
21569 and spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may
21570 suffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise
21571 have to impose upon the people.
21572 
21573 And when these fail?
21574 
21575 Why, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male or
21576 female, will be maintained out of his father's estate.
21577 
21578 You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being,
21579 will maintain him and his companions?
21580 
21581 Yes, he said; they cannot help themselves.
21582 
21583 But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up son
21584 ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should be
21585 supported by the son? The father did not bring him into being, or settle
21586 him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should himself
21587 be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble
21588 of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect him, and that
21589 by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and
21590 aristocratic, as they are termed. And so he bids him and his companions
21591 depart, just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous
21592 son and his undesirable associates.
21593 
21594 By heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster he has
21595 been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out, he
21596 will find that he is weak and his son strong.
21597 
21598 Why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? What!
21599 beat his father if he opposes him?
21600 
21601 Yes, he will, having first disarmed him.
21602 
21603 Then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and this
21604 is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as the
21605 saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of
21606 freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves. Thus
21607 liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest
21608 and bitterest form of slavery.
21609 
21610 True, he said.
21611 
21612 Very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently
21613 discussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from
21614 democracy to tyranny?
21615 
21616 Yes, quite enough, he said.
21617 
21618 
21619 
21620 
21621 BOOK IX.
21622 
21623 Last of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more to
21624 ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in
21625 happiness or in misery?
21626 
21627 Yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.
21628 
21629 There is, however, I said, a previous question which remains unanswered.
21630 
21631 What question?
21632 
21633 I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number
21634 of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always
21635 be confused.
21636 
21637 Well, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.
21638 
21639 Very true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand:
21640 Certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be
21641 unlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are
21642 controlled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail
21643 over them--either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak;
21644 while in the case of others they are stronger, and there are more of
21645 them.
21646 
21647 Which appetites do you mean?
21648 
21649 I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling
21650 power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or
21651 drink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy
21652 his desires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime--not excepting
21653 incest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of
21654 forbidden food--which at such a time, when he has parted company with
21655 all shame and sense, a man may not be ready to commit.
21656 
21657 Most true, he said.
21658 
21659 But when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going
21660 to sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble
21661 thoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having
21662 first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just
21663 enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and
21664 pains from interfering with the higher principle--which he leaves in
21665 the solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to
21666 the knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when
21667 again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel against
21668 any one--I say, when, after pacifying the two irrational principles, he
21669 rouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes his rest, then,
21670 as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and is least likely to be the
21671 sport of fantastic and lawless visions.
21672 
21673 I quite agree.
21674 
21675 In saying this I have been running into a digression; but the point
21676 which I desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is
21677 a lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. Pray, consider
21678 whether I am right, and you agree with me.
21679 
21680 Yes, I agree.
21681 
21682 And now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic
21683 man. He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under
21684 a miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but
21685 discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and
21686 ornament?
21687 
21688 True.
21689 
21690 And then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort of
21691 people, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite
21692 extreme from an abhorrence of his father's meanness. At last, being a
21693 better man than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until he
21694 halted midway and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but
21695 of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures. After this
21696 manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?
21697 
21698 Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.
21699 
21700 And now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive this
21701 man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his father's
21702 principles.
21703 
21704 I can imagine him.
21705 
21706 Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son
21707 which has already happened to the father:--he is drawn into a perfectly
21708 lawless life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his
21709 father and friends take part with his moderate desires, and the opposite
21710 party assist the opposite ones. As soon as these dire magicians and
21711 tyrant-makers find that they are losing their hold on him, they contrive
21712 to implant in him a master passion, to be lord over his idle and
21713 spendthrift lusts--a sort of monstrous winged drone--that is the only
21714 image which will adequately describe him.
21715 
21716 Yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.
21717 
21718 And when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and
21719 garlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let
21720 loose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of
21721 desire which they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this
21722 lord of the soul, having Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks
21723 out into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions or
21724 appetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense of
21725 shame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and casts
21726 them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to
21727 the full.
21728 
21729 Yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.
21730 
21731 And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?
21732 
21733 I should not wonder.
21734 
21735 Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?
21736 
21737 He has.
21738 
21739 And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will
21740 fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the
21741 gods?
21742 
21743 That he will.
21744 
21745 And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being
21746 when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he
21747 becomes drunken, lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that so?
21748 
21749 Assuredly.
21750 
21751 Such is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he live?
21752 
21753 Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.
21754 
21755 I imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will be
21756 feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort
21757 of thing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the
21758 concerns of his soul.
21759 
21760 That is certain.
21761 
21762 Yes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,
21763 and their demands are many.
21764 
21765 They are indeed, he said.
21766 
21767 His revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.
21768 
21769 True.
21770 
21771 Then comes debt and the cutting down of his property.
21772 
21773 Of course.
21774 
21775 When he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest
21776 like young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them,
21777 and especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them,
21778 is in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil
21779 of his property, in order that he may gratify them?
21780 
21781 Yes, that is sure to be the case.
21782 
21783 He must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains and
21784 pangs.
21785 
21786 He must.
21787 
21788 And as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new got
21789 the better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger
21790 will claim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has
21791 spent his own share of the property, he will take a slice of theirs.
21792 
21793 No doubt he will.
21794 
21795 And if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all to
21796 cheat and deceive them.
21797 
21798 Very true.
21799 
21800 And if he fails, then he will use force and plunder them.
21801 
21802 Yes, probably.
21803 
21804 And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?
21805 Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?
21806 
21807 Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.
21808 
21809 But, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some new-fangled love of a
21810 harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe that
21811 he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary
21812 to his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the
21813 other, when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under
21814 like circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old father,
21815 first and most indispensable of friends, for the sake of some
21816 newly-found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable?
21817 
21818 Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.
21819 
21820 Truly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and
21821 mother.
21822 
21823 He is indeed, he replied.
21824 
21825 He first takes their property, and when that fails, and pleasures are
21826 beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a house,
21827 or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds to
21828 clear a temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child,
21829 and which gave judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those
21830 others which have just been emancipated, and are now the body-guard of
21831 love and share his empire. These in his democratic days, when he was
21832 still subject to the laws and to his father, were only let loose in
21833 the dreams of sleep. But now that he is under the dominion of love, he
21834 becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in
21835 a dream only; he will commit the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food,
21836 or be guilty of any other horrid act. Love is his tyrant, and lives
21837 lordly in him and lawlessly, and being himself a king, leads him on, as
21838 a tyrant leads a State, to the performance of any reckless deed by which
21839 he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates, whether those
21840 whom evil communications have brought in from without, or those whom
21841 he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar
21842 evil nature in himself. Have we not here a picture of his way of life?
21843 
21844 Yes, indeed, he said.
21845 
21846 And if there are only a few of them in the State, and the rest of the
21847 people are well disposed, they go away and become the body-guard or
21848 mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a
21849 war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many little pieces
21850 of mischief in the city.
21851 
21852 What sort of mischief?
21853 
21854 For example, they are the thieves, burglars, cut-purses, foot-pads,
21855 robbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able
21856 to speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.
21857 
21858 A small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are few in
21859 number.
21860 
21861 Yes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all these
21862 things, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do not
21863 come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class and
21864 their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,
21865 assisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among
21866 themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, and him
21867 they create their tyrant.
21868 
21869 Yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant.
21870 
21871 If the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began
21872 by beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he
21873 beats them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the
21874 Cretans say, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced
21875 to be their rulers and masters. This is the end of his passions and
21876 desires.
21877 
21878 Exactly.
21879 
21880 When such men are only private individuals and before they get power,
21881 this is their character; they associate entirely with their own
21882 flatterers or ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they
21883 in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them: they profess
21884 every sort of affection for them; but when they have gained their point
21885 they know them no more.
21886 
21887 Yes, truly.
21888 
21889 They are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of
21890 anybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship.
21891 
21892 Certainly not.
21893 
21894 And may we not rightly call such men treacherous?
21895 
21896 No question.
21897 
21898 Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?
21899 
21900 Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.
21901 
21902 Let us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man: he
21903 is the waking reality of what we dreamed.
21904 
21905 Most true.
21906 
21907 And this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and the
21908 longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.
21909 
21910 That is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to answer.
21911 
21912 And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the most
21913 miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually
21914 and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in
21915 general?
21916 
21917 Yes, he said, inevitably.
21918 
21919 And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical State, and
21920 the democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the
21921 others?
21922 
21923 Certainly.
21924 
21925 And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation
21926 to man?
21927 
21928 To be sure.
21929 
21930 Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city
21931 which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?
21932 
21933 They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and
21934 the other is the very worst.
21935 
21936 There can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore
21937 I will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision
21938 about their relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow
21939 ourselves to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is
21940 only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us
21941 go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about, and
21942 then we will give our opinion.
21943 
21944 A fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that a
21945 tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king
21946 the happiest.
21947 
21948 And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request,
21949 that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through
21950 human nature? he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and
21951 is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to
21952 the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. May I suppose
21953 that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able
21954 to judge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at
21955 his dally life and known him in his family relations, where he may be
21956 seen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in the hour of public
21957 danger--he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant
21958 when compared with other men?
21959 
21960 That again, he said, is a very fair proposal.
21961 
21962 Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and
21963 have before now met with such a person? We shall then have some one who
21964 will answer our enquiries.
21965 
21966 By all means.
21967 
21968 Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the
21969 State; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other
21970 of them, will you tell me their respective conditions?
21971 
21972 What do you mean? he asked.
21973 
21974 Beginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which is
21975 governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?
21976 
21977 No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.
21978 
21979 And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a
21980 State?
21981 
21982 Yes, he said, I see that there are--a few; but the people, speaking
21983 generally, and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved.
21984 
21985 Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule
21986 prevail? his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity--the best elements
21987 in him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the
21988 worst and maddest.
21989 
21990 Inevitably.
21991 
21992 And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman,
21993 or of a slave?
21994 
21995 He has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.
21996 
21997 And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of
21998 acting voluntarily?
21999 
22000 Utterly incapable.
22001 
22002 And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul
22003 taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is a
22004 gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?
22005 
22006 Certainly.
22007 
22008 And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?
22009 
22010 Poor.
22011 
22012 And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?
22013 
22014 True.
22015 
22016 And must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear?
22017 
22018 Yes, indeed.
22019 
22020 Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow
22021 and groaning and pain?
22022 
22023 Certainly not.
22024 
22025 And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery
22026 than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?
22027 
22028 Impossible.
22029 
22030 Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State
22031 to be the most miserable of States?
22032 
22033 And I was right, he said.
22034 
22035 Certainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical
22036 man, what do you say of him?
22037 
22038 I say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.
22039 
22040 There, I said, I think that you are beginning to go wrong.
22041 
22042 What do you mean?
22043 
22044 I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.
22045 
22046 Then who is more miserable?
22047 
22048 One of whom I am about to speak.
22049 
22050 Who is that?
22051 
22052 He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private life
22053 has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant.
22054 
22055 From what has been said, I gather that you are right.
22056 
22057 Yes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more
22058 certain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this
22059 respecting good and evil is the greatest.
22060 
22061 Very true, he said.
22062 
22063 Let me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, throw a light
22064 upon this subject.
22065 
22066 What is your illustration?
22067 
22068 The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from
22069 them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have
22070 slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.
22071 
22072 Yes, that is the difference.
22073 
22074 You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from
22075 their servants?
22076 
22077 What should they fear?
22078 
22079 Nothing. But do you observe the reason of this?
22080 
22081 Yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the
22082 protection of each individual.
22083 
22084 Very true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master say of
22085 some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,
22086 carried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to
22087 help him--will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and
22088 children should be put to death by his slaves?
22089 
22090 Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.
22091 
22092 The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his
22093 slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things, much
22094 against his will--he will have to cajole his own servants.
22095 
22096 Yes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.
22097 
22098 And suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with
22099 neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and
22100 who, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?
22101 
22102 His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere
22103 surrounded and watched by enemies.
22104 
22105 And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound--he
22106 who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of
22107 fears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone, of all
22108 men in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or to see the
22109 things which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole like
22110 a woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who
22111 goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.
22112 
22113 Very true, he said.
22114 
22115 And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his own
22116 person--the tyrannical man, I mean--whom you just now decided to be the
22117 most miserable of all--will not he be yet more miserable when, instead
22118 of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a public
22119 tyrant? He has to be master of others when he is not master of himself:
22120 he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his
22121 life, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other men.
22122 
22123 Yes, he said, the similitude is most exact.
22124 
22125 Is not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant lead a
22126 worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?
22127 
22128 Certainly.
22129 
22130 He who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave,
22131 and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and to
22132 be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which he is
22133 utterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly
22134 poor, if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his life
22135 long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions,
22136 even as the State which he resembles: and surely the resemblance holds?
22137 
22138 Very true, he said.
22139 
22140 Moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power: he
22141 becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more unjust,
22142 more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the purveyor
22143 and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is that he is
22144 supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable as
22145 himself.
22146 
22147 No man of any sense will dispute your words.
22148 
22149 Come then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests
22150 proclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first
22151 in the scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others
22152 follow: there are five of them in all--they are the royal, timocratical,
22153 oligarchical, democratical, tyrannical.
22154 
22155 The decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses
22156 coming on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they
22157 enter, by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.
22158 
22159 Need we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston (the
22160 best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest, and
22161 that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself; and
22162 that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and that
22163 this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest
22164 tyrant of his State?
22165 
22166 Make the proclamation yourself, he said.
22167 
22168 And shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and men'?
22169 
22170 Let the words be added.
22171 
22172 Then this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is another, which
22173 may also have some weight.
22174 
22175 What is that?
22176 
22177 The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that
22178 the individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three
22179 principles, the division may, I think, furnish a new demonstration.
22180 
22181 Of what nature?
22182 
22183 It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures
22184 correspond; also three desires and governing powers.
22185 
22186 How do you mean? he said.
22187 
22188 There is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,
22189 another with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no
22190 special name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from
22191 the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and
22192 drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of
22193 it; also money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied by
22194 the help of money.
22195 
22196 That is true, he said.
22197 
22198 If we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were
22199 concerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single
22200 notion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul
22201 as loving gain or money.
22202 
22203 I agree with you.
22204 
22205 Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering
22206 and getting fame?
22207 
22208 True.
22209 
22210 Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious--would the term be
22211 suitable?
22212 
22213 Extremely suitable.
22214 
22215 On the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge is
22216 wholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others
22217 for gain or fame.
22218 
22219 Far less.
22220 
22221 'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly
22222 apply to that part of the soul?
22223 
22224 Certainly.
22225 
22226 One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in
22227 others, as may happen?
22228 
22229 Yes.
22230 
22231 Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of
22232 men--lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?
22233 
22234 Exactly.
22235 
22236 And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?
22237 
22238 Very true.
22239 
22240 Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn
22241 which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his
22242 own and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the
22243 vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid
22244 advantages of gold and silver?
22245 
22246 True, he said.
22247 
22248 And the lover of honour--what will be his opinion? Will he not think
22249 that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning,
22250 if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?
22251 
22252 Very true.
22253 
22254 And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value on
22255 other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth,
22256 and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the
22257 heaven of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary,
22258 under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather
22259 not have them?
22260 
22261 There can be no doubt of that, he replied.
22262 
22263 Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in
22264 dispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable,
22265 or better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless--how
22266 shall we know who speaks truly?
22267 
22268 I cannot myself tell, he said.
22269 
22270 Well, but what ought to be the criterion? Is any better than experience
22271 and wisdom and reason?
22272 
22273 There cannot be a better, he said.
22274 
22275 Then, I said, reflect. Of the three individuals, which has the greatest
22276 experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? Has the lover of
22277 gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of
22278 the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of
22279 gain?
22280 
22281 The philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has
22282 of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his
22283 childhood upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not
22284 of necessity tasted--or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could
22285 hardly have tasted--the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.
22286 
22287 Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain,
22288 for he has a double experience?
22289 
22290 Yes, very great.
22291 
22292 Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the
22293 lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?
22294 
22295 Nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their
22296 object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have
22297 their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have
22298 experience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be
22299 found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.
22300 
22301 His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?
22302 
22303 Far better.
22304 
22305 And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?
22306 
22307 Certainly.
22308 
22309 Further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not
22310 possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?
22311 
22312 What faculty?
22313 
22314 Reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.
22315 
22316 Yes.
22317 
22318 And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?
22319 
22320 Certainly.
22321 
22322 If wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of the
22323 lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?
22324 
22325 Assuredly.
22326 
22327 Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgment of the
22328 ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?
22329 
22330 Clearly.
22331 
22332 But since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges--
22333 
22334 The only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are
22335 approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.
22336 
22337 And so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent
22338 part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in
22339 whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.
22340 
22341 Unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he
22342 approves of his own life.
22343 
22344 And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the
22345 pleasure which is next?
22346 
22347 Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to
22348 himself than the money-maker.
22349 
22350 Last comes the lover of gain?
22351 
22352 Very true, he said.
22353 
22354 Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in
22355 this conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to
22356 Olympian Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure
22357 except that of the wise is quite true and pure--all others are a shadow
22358 only; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of
22359 falls?
22360 
22361 Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?
22362 
22363 I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.
22364 
22365 Proceed.
22366 
22367 Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?
22368 
22369 True.
22370 
22371 And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain?
22372 
22373 There is.
22374 
22375 A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about
22376 either--that is what you mean?
22377 
22378 Yes.
22379 
22380 You remember what people say when they are sick?
22381 
22382 What do they say?
22383 
22384 That after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they never
22385 knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill.
22386 
22387 Yes, I know, he said.
22388 
22389 And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must have heard them
22390 say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?
22391 
22392 I have.
22393 
22394 And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and
22395 cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them
22396 as the greatest pleasure?
22397 
22398 Yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be at
22399 rest.
22400 
22401 Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be
22402 painful?
22403 
22404 Doubtless, he said.
22405 
22406 Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be
22407 pain?
22408 
22409 So it would seem.
22410 
22411 But can that which is neither become both?
22412 
22413 I should say not.
22414 
22415 And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?
22416 
22417 Yes.
22418 
22419 But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,
22420 and in a mean between them?
22421 
22422 Yes.
22423 
22424 How, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is
22425 pleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?
22426 
22427 Impossible.
22428 
22429 This then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is to say, the
22430 rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful,
22431 and painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these
22432 representations, when tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real
22433 but a sort of imposition?
22434 
22435 That is the inference.
22436 
22437 Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and
22438 you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that pleasure
22439 is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.
22440 
22441 What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?
22442 
22443 There are many of them: take as an example the pleasures of smell, which
22444 are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment, and
22445 when they depart leave no pain behind them.
22446 
22447 Most true, he said.
22448 
22449 Let us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the
22450 cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.
22451 
22452 No.
22453 
22454 Still, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul
22455 through the body are generally of this sort--they are reliefs of pain.
22456 
22457 That is true.
22458 
22459 And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like
22460 nature?
22461 
22462 Yes.
22463 
22464 Shall I give you an illustration of them?
22465 
22466 Let me hear.
22467 
22468 You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and
22469 middle region?
22470 
22471 I should.
22472 
22473 And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would
22474 he not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the middle
22475 and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in the
22476 upper region, if he has never seen the true upper world?
22477 
22478 To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?
22479 
22480 But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine,
22481 that he was descending?
22482 
22483 No doubt.
22484 
22485 All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle
22486 and lower regions?
22487 
22488 Yes.
22489 
22490 Then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth, as
22491 they have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong
22492 ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when
22493 they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think
22494 the pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when
22495 drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly
22496 believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they,
22497 not knowing pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain,
22498 which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white--can you
22499 wonder, I say, at this?
22500 
22501 No, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.
22502 
22503 Look at the matter thus:--Hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions
22504 of the bodily state?
22505 
22506 Yes.
22507 
22508 And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?
22509 
22510 True.
22511 
22512 And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?
22513 
22514 Certainly.
22515 
22516 And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that
22517 which has more existence the truer?
22518 
22519 Clearly, from that which has more.
22520 
22521 What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your
22522 judgment--those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of
22523 sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion
22524 and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue? Put
22525 the question in this way:--Which has a more pure being--that which is
22526 concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of
22527 such a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned
22528 with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and
22529 mortal?
22530 
22531 Far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with the
22532 invariable.
22533 
22534 And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same
22535 degree as of essence?
22536 
22537 Yes, of knowledge in the same degree.
22538 
22539 And of truth in the same degree?
22540 
22541 Yes.
22542 
22543 And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of
22544 essence?
22545 
22546 Necessarily.
22547 
22548 Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the
22549 body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service
22550 of the soul?
22551 
22552 Far less.
22553 
22554 And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?
22555 
22556 Yes.
22557 
22558 What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real
22559 existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less
22560 real existence and is less real?
22561 
22562 Of course.
22563 
22564 And if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according
22565 to nature, that which is more really filled with more real being
22566 will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which
22567 participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied,
22568 and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure?
22569 
22570 Unquestionably.
22571 
22572 Those then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with
22573 gluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and
22574 in this region they move at random throughout life, but they never pass
22575 into the true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever
22576 find their way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do
22577 they taste of pure and abiding pleasure. Like cattle, with their eyes
22578 always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth, that is,
22579 to the dining-table, they fatten and feed and breed, and, in their
22580 excessive love of these delights, they kick and butt at one another with
22581 horns and hoofs which are made of iron; and they kill one another by
22582 reason of their insatiable lust. For they fill themselves with that
22583 which is not substantial, and the part of themselves which they fill is
22584 also unsubstantial and incontinent.
22585 
22586 Verily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many like
22587 an oracle.
22588 
22589 Their pleasures are mixed with pains--how can they be otherwise? For
22590 they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by
22591 contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant
22592 in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought
22593 about as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of
22594 Helen at Troy in ignorance of the truth.
22595 
22596 Something of that sort must inevitably happen.
22597 
22598 And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element
22599 of the soul? Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into
22600 action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or
22601 violent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking
22602 to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without
22603 reason or sense?
22604 
22605 Yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.
22606 
22607 Then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,
22608 when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company
22609 of reason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which
22610 wisdom shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest
22611 degree which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and
22612 they will have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that which is
22613 best for each one is also most natural to him?
22614 
22615 Yes, certainly; the best is the most natural.
22616 
22617 And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there
22618 is no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their
22619 own business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which
22620 they are capable?
22621 
22622 Exactly.
22623 
22624 But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in
22625 attaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a
22626 pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?
22627 
22628 True.
22629 
22630 And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and
22631 reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?
22632 
22633 Yes.
22634 
22635 And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance
22636 from law and order?
22637 
22638 Clearly.
22639 
22640 And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest
22641 distance? Yes.
22642 
22643 And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?
22644 
22645 Yes.
22646 
22647 Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural
22648 pleasure, and the king at the least?
22649 
22650 Certainly.
22651 
22652 But if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most
22653 pleasantly?
22654 
22655 Inevitably.
22656 
22657 Would you know the measure of the interval which separates them?
22658 
22659 Will you tell me?
22660 
22661 There appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: now
22662 the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he
22663 has run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode
22664 with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure
22665 of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.
22666 
22667 How do you mean?
22668 
22669 I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the
22670 oligarch; the democrat was in the middle?
22671 
22672 Yes.
22673 
22674 And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an
22675 image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure
22676 of the oligarch?
22677 
22678 He will.
22679 
22680 And the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal
22681 and aristocratical?
22682 
22683 Yes, he is third.
22684 
22685 Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number
22686 which is three times three?
22687 
22688 Manifestly.
22689 
22690 The shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of
22691 length will be a plane figure.
22692 
22693 Certainly.
22694 
22695 And if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no
22696 difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is
22697 parted from the king.
22698 
22699 Yes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.
22700 
22701 Or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by
22702 which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he will
22703 find him, when the multiplication is completed, living 729 times more
22704 pleasantly, and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.
22705 
22706 What a wonderful calculation! And how enormous is the distance which
22707 separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain!
22708 
22709 Yet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns human
22710 life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and
22711 years. (729 NEARLY equals the number of days and nights in the year.)
22712 
22713 Yes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with them.
22714 
22715 Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil
22716 and unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of
22717 life and in beauty and virtue?
22718 
22719 Immeasurably greater.
22720 
22721 Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument, we
22722 may revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one saying
22723 that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be
22724 just?
22725 
22726 Yes, that was said.
22727 
22728 Now then, having determined the power and quality of justice and
22729 injustice, let us have a little conversation with him.
22730 
22731 What shall we say to him?
22732 
22733 Let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words
22734 presented before his eyes.
22735 
22736 Of what sort?
22737 
22738 An ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient
22739 mythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are many
22740 others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one.
22741 
22742 There are said of have been such unions.
22743 
22744 Then do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,
22745 having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he
22746 is able to generate and metamorphose at will.
22747 
22748 You suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is more
22749 pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model as
22750 you propose.
22751 
22752 Suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third of a
22753 man, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the
22754 second.
22755 
22756 That, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you say.
22757 
22758 And now join them, and let the three grow into one.
22759 
22760 That has been accomplished.
22761 
22762 Next fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man, so
22763 that he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer hull,
22764 may believe the beast to be a single human creature.
22765 
22766 I have done so, he said.
22767 
22768 And now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human
22769 creature to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply
22770 that, if he be right, it is profitable for this creature to feast
22771 the multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the lion-like
22772 qualities, but to starve and weaken the man, who is consequently liable
22773 to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two; and he is
22774 not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another--he
22775 ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another.
22776 
22777 Certainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice says.
22778 
22779 To him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so
22780 speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the
22781 most complete mastery over the entire human creature. He should watch
22782 over the many-headed monster like a good husbandman, fostering and
22783 cultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the wild ones from
22784 growing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally, and in common care
22785 of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and
22786 with himself.
22787 
22788 Yes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice say.
22789 
22790 And so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or
22791 advantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and
22792 the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant?
22793 
22794 Yes, from every point of view.
22795 
22796 Come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not
22797 intentionally in error. 'Sweet Sir,' we will say to him, 'what think
22798 you of things esteemed noble and ignoble? Is not the noble that which
22799 subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the
22800 ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?' He can hardly avoid
22801 saying Yes--can he now?
22802 
22803 Not if he has any regard for my opinion.
22804 
22805 But, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question:
22806 'Then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the
22807 condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?
22808 Who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for
22809 money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men,
22810 would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he
22811 received? And will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who
22812 remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless
22813 and detestable? Eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her husband's
22814 life, but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin.'
22815 
22816 Yes, said Glaucon, far worse--I will answer for him.
22817 
22818 Has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge
22819 multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?
22820 
22821 Clearly.
22822 
22823 And men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent
22824 element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?
22825 
22826 Yes.
22827 
22828 And luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this
22829 same creature, and make a coward of him?
22830 
22831 Very true.
22832 
22833 And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates
22834 the spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money,
22835 of which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his
22836 youth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a
22837 monkey?
22838 
22839 True, he said.
22840 
22841 And why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach? Only because
22842 they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual is
22843 unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and
22844 his great study is how to flatter them.
22845 
22846 Such appears to be the reason.
22847 
22848 And therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of
22849 the best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in whom
22850 the Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the
22851 servant, but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom
22852 dwelling within him; or, if this be impossible, then by an external
22853 authority, in order that we may be all, as far as possible, under the
22854 same government, friends and equals.
22855 
22856 True, he said.
22857 
22858 And this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is the
22859 ally of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we
22860 exercise over children, and the refusal to let them be free until we
22861 have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of
22862 a state, and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their
22863 hearts a guardian and ruler like our own, and when this is done they may
22864 go their ways.
22865 
22866 Yes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.
22867 
22868 From what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a man
22869 is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will
22870 make him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his
22871 wickedness?
22872 
22873 From no point of view at all.
22874 
22875 What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?
22876 He who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and
22877 punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the
22878 gentler element in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected and
22879 ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom, more
22880 than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and health,
22881 in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body.
22882 
22883 Certainly, he said.
22884 
22885 To this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies
22886 of his life. And in the first place, he will honour studies which
22887 impress these qualities on his soul and will disregard others?
22888 
22889 Clearly, he said.
22890 
22891 In the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, and
22892 so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures, that
22893 he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first object
22894 will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is likely
22895 thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to attemper the
22896 body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?
22897 
22898 Certainly he will, if he has true music in him.
22899 
22900 And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and
22901 harmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be
22902 dazzled by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his
22903 own infinite harm?
22904 
22905 Certainly not, he said.
22906 
22907 He will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no
22908 disorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or
22909 from want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and
22910 gain or spend according to his means.
22911 
22912 Very true.
22913 
22914 And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours
22915 as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private
22916 or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?
22917 
22918 Then, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.
22919 
22920 By the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which is his own he certainly
22921 will, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a
22922 divine call.
22923 
22924 I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we
22925 are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe
22926 that there is such an one anywhere on earth?
22927 
22928 In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which
22929 he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in
22930 order. But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no
22931 matter; for he will live after the manner of that city, having nothing
22932 to do with any other.
22933 
22934 I think so, he said.
22935 
22936 
22937 
22938 
22939 BOOK X.
22940 
22941 Of the many excellences which I perceive in the order of our State,
22942 there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule
22943 about poetry.
22944 
22945 To what do you refer?
22946 
22947 To the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to be
22948 received; as I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have
22949 been distinguished.
22950 
22951 What do you mean?
22952 
22953 Speaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words repeated
22954 to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe--but I do not
22955 mind saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the
22956 understanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true
22957 nature is the only antidote to them.
22958 
22959 Explain the purport of your remark.
22960 
22961 Well, I will tell you, although I have always from my earliest youth had
22962 an awe and love of Homer, which even now makes the words falter on
22963 my lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that
22964 charming tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than the
22965 truth, and therefore I will speak out.
22966 
22967 Very good, he said.
22968 
22969 Listen to me then, or rather, answer me.
22970 
22971 Put your question.
22972 
22973 Can you tell me what imitation is? for I really do not know.
22974 
22975 A likely thing, then, that I should know.
22976 
22977 Why not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the
22978 keener.
22979 
22980 Very true, he said; but in your presence, even if I had any faint
22981 notion, I could not muster courage to utter it. Will you enquire
22982 yourself?
22983 
22984 Well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever a
22985 number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a
22986 corresponding idea or form:--do you understand me?
22987 
22988 I do.
22989 
22990 Let us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the
22991 world--plenty of them, are there not?
22992 
22993 Yes.
22994 
22995 But there are only two ideas or forms of them--one the idea of a bed,
22996 the other of a table.
22997 
22998 True.
22999 
23000 And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our
23001 use, in accordance with the idea--that is our way of speaking in this
23002 and similar instances--but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how
23003 could he?
23004 
23005 Impossible.
23006 
23007 And there is another artist,--I should like to know what you would say
23008 of him.
23009 
23010 Who is he?
23011 
23012 One who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.
23013 
23014 What an extraordinary man!
23015 
23016 Wait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. For
23017 this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but
23018 plants and animals, himself and all other things--the earth and heaven,
23019 and the things which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the gods
23020 also.
23021 
23022 He must be a wizard and no mistake.
23023 
23024 Oh! you are incredulous, are you? Do you mean that there is no such
23025 maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all
23026 these things but in another not? Do you see that there is a way in which
23027 you could make them all yourself?
23028 
23029 What way?
23030 
23031 An easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat
23032 might be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of
23033 turning a mirror round and round--you would soon enough make the sun and
23034 the heavens, and the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants,
23035 and all the other things of which we were just now speaking, in the
23036 mirror.
23037 
23038 Yes, he said; but they would be appearances only.
23039 
23040 Very good, I said, you are coming to the point now. And the painter too
23041 is, as I conceive, just such another--a creator of appearances, is he
23042 not?
23043 
23044 Of course.
23045 
23046 But then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. And yet
23047 there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?
23048 
23049 Yes, he said, but not a real bed.
23050 
23051 And what of the maker of the bed? were you not saying that he too makes,
23052 not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed,
23053 but only a particular bed?
23054 
23055 Yes, I did.
23056 
23057 Then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true
23058 existence, but only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to
23059 say that the work of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has
23060 real existence, he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.
23061 
23062 At any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not speaking
23063 the truth.
23064 
23065 No wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth.
23066 
23067 No wonder.
23068 
23069 Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire
23070 who this imitator is?
23071 
23072 If you please.
23073 
23074 Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made by
23075 God, as I think that we may say--for no one else can be the maker?
23076 
23077 No.
23078 
23079 There is another which is the work of the carpenter?
23080 
23081 Yes.
23082 
23083 And the work of the painter is a third?
23084 
23085 Yes.
23086 
23087 Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who
23088 superintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?
23089 
23090 Yes, there are three of them.
23091 
23092 God, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature and
23093 one only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever
23094 will be made by God.
23095 
23096 Why is that?
23097 
23098 Because even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind
23099 them which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the
23100 ideal bed and not the two others.
23101 
23102 Very true, he said.
23103 
23104 God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not
23105 a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed
23106 which is essentially and by nature one only.
23107 
23108 So we believe.
23109 
23110 Shall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the bed?
23111 
23112 Yes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He is
23113 the author of this and of all other things.
23114 
23115 And what shall we say of the carpenter--is not he also the maker of the
23116 bed?
23117 
23118 Yes.
23119 
23120 But would you call the painter a creator and maker?
23121 
23122 Certainly not.
23123 
23124 Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?
23125 
23126 I think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of
23127 that which the others make.
23128 
23129 Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature
23130 an imitator?
23131 
23132 Certainly, he said.
23133 
23134 And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other
23135 imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?
23136 
23137 That appears to be so.
23138 
23139 Then about the imitator we are agreed. And what about the painter?--I
23140 would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which
23141 originally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?
23142 
23143 The latter.
23144 
23145 As they are or as they appear? you have still to determine this.
23146 
23147 What do you mean?
23148 
23149 I mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,
23150 obliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will
23151 appear different, but there is no difference in reality. And the same of
23152 all things.
23153 
23154 Yes, he said, the difference is only apparent.
23155 
23156 Now let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting
23157 designed to be--an imitation of things as they are, or as they
23158 appear--of appearance or of reality?
23159 
23160 Of appearance.
23161 
23162 Then the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do all
23163 things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that part
23164 an image. For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, or
23165 any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he is
23166 a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows
23167 them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy
23168 that they are looking at a real carpenter.
23169 
23170 Certainly.
23171 
23172 And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all
23173 the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing
23174 with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man--whoever tells us
23175 this, I think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who
23176 is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and
23177 whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse
23178 the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.
23179 
23180 Most true.
23181 
23182 And so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer, who
23183 is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as well
23184 as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose
23185 well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge
23186 can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may
23187 not be a similar illusion. Perhaps they may have come across imitators
23188 and been deceived by them; they may not have remembered when they saw
23189 their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the
23190 truth, and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth,
23191 because they are appearances only and not realities? Or, after all, they
23192 may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which
23193 they seem to the many to speak so well?
23194 
23195 The question, he said, should by all means be considered.
23196 
23197 Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as
23198 well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making
23199 branch? Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life,
23200 as if he had nothing higher in him?
23201 
23202 I should say not.
23203 
23204 The real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested in
23205 realities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials
23206 of himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of
23207 encomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them.
23208 
23209 Yes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour and
23210 profit.
23211 
23212 Then, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about medicine, or
23213 any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not
23214 going to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients
23215 like Asclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such as the
23216 Asclepiads were, or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts
23217 at second-hand; but we have a right to know respecting military tactics,
23218 politics, education, which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his
23219 poems, and we may fairly ask him about them. 'Friend Homer,' then we say
23220 to him, 'if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say
23221 of virtue, and not in the third--not an image maker or imitator--and
23222 if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in
23223 private or public life, tell us what State was ever better governed by
23224 your help? The good order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many
23225 other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others;
23226 but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done
23227 them any good? Italy and Sicily boast of Charondas, and there is Solon
23228 who is renowned among us; but what city has anything to say about you?'
23229 Is there any city which he might name?
23230 
23231 I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend that
23232 he was a legislator.
23233 
23234 Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully
23235 by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?
23236 
23237 There is not.
23238 
23239 Or is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human
23240 life, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other
23241 ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?
23242 
23243 There is absolutely nothing of the kind.
23244 
23245 But, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide or
23246 teacher of any? Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate
23247 with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such
23248 as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his
23249 wisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the
23250 order which was named after him?
23251 
23252 Nothing of the kind is recorded of him. For surely, Socrates,
23253 Creophylus, the companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name
23254 always makes us laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity,
23255 if, as is said, Homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own
23256 day when he was alive?
23257 
23258 Yes, I replied, that is the tradition. But can you imagine, Glaucon,
23259 that if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind--if he
23260 had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator--can you imagine,
23261 I say, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and
23262 loved by them? Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos, and a host of
23263 others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: 'You will never be
23264 able to manage either your own house or your own State until you appoint
23265 us to be your ministers of education'--and this ingenious device of
23266 theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their companions
23267 all but carry them about on their shoulders. And is it conceivable that
23268 the contemporaries of Homer, or again of Hesiod, would have allowed
23269 either of them to go about as rhapsodists, if they had really been able
23270 to make mankind virtuous? Would they not have been as unwilling to part
23271 with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with
23272 them? Or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have
23273 followed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?
23274 
23275 Yes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.
23276 
23277 Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning
23278 with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like,
23279 but the truth they never reach? The poet is like a painter who, as
23280 we have already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though he
23281 understands nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for
23282 those who know no more than he does, and judge only by colours and
23283 figures.
23284 
23285 Quite so.
23286 
23287 In like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on
23288 the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature only
23289 enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as he is,
23290 and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of cobbling,
23291 or of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and harmony and
23292 rhythm, he speaks very well--such is the sweet influence which melody
23293 and rhythm by nature have. And I think that you must have observed again
23294 and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped
23295 of the colours which music puts upon them, and recited in simple prose.
23296 
23297 Yes, he said.
23298 
23299 They are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only
23300 blooming; and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?
23301 
23302 Exactly.
23303 
23304 Here is another point: The imitator or maker of the image knows nothing
23305 of true existence; he knows appearances only. Am I not right?
23306 
23307 Yes.
23308 
23309 Then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half
23310 an explanation.
23311 
23312 Proceed.
23313 
23314 Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?
23315 
23316 Yes.
23317 
23318 And the worker in leather and brass will make them?
23319 
23320 Certainly.
23321 
23322 But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? Nay,
23323 hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the
23324 horseman who knows how to use them--he knows their right form.
23325 
23326 Most true.
23327 
23328 And may we not say the same of all things?
23329 
23330 What?
23331 
23332 That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one which
23333 uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?
23334 
23335 Yes.
23336 
23337 And the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or
23338 inanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which
23339 nature or the artist has intended them.
23340 
23341 True.
23342 
23343 Then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and
23344 he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop
23345 themselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the
23346 flute-maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he
23347 will tell him how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to
23348 his instructions?
23349 
23350 Of course.
23351 
23352 The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and
23353 badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is
23354 told by him?
23355 
23356 True.
23357 
23358 The instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it
23359 the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain
23360 from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what
23361 he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?
23362 
23363 True.
23364 
23365 But will the imitator have either? Will he know from use whether or no
23366 his drawing is correct or beautiful? or will he have right opinion
23367 from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him
23368 instructions about what he should draw?
23369 
23370 Neither.
23371 
23372 Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about
23373 the goodness or badness of his imitations?
23374 
23375 I suppose not.
23376 
23377 The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about
23378 his own creations?
23379 
23380 Nay, very much the reverse.
23381 
23382 And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing
23383 good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which
23384 appears to be good to the ignorant multitude?
23385 
23386 Just so.
23387 
23388 Thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no
23389 knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates. Imitation is only a kind
23390 of play or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in Iambic or
23391 in Heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?
23392 
23393 Very true.
23394 
23395 And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be
23396 concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?
23397 
23398 Certainly.
23399 
23400 And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?
23401 
23402 What do you mean?
23403 
23404 I will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small
23405 when seen at a distance?
23406 
23407 True.
23408 
23409 And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water,
23410 and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to
23411 the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort
23412 of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the
23413 human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and
23414 shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us
23415 like magic.
23416 
23417 True.
23418 
23419 And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the
23420 rescue of the human understanding--there is the beauty of them--and the
23421 apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery
23422 over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?
23423 
23424 Most true.
23425 
23426 And this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational
23427 principle in the soul?
23428 
23429 To be sure.
23430 
23431 And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are
23432 equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an
23433 apparent contradiction?
23434 
23435 True.
23436 
23437 But were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible--the same
23438 faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same
23439 thing?
23440 
23441 Very true.
23442 
23443 Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is
23444 not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?
23445 
23446 True.
23447 
23448 And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to
23449 measure and calculation?
23450 
23451 Certainly.
23452 
23453 And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of
23454 the soul?
23455 
23456 No doubt.
23457 
23458 This was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said
23459 that painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their own
23460 proper work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and friends
23461 and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from
23462 reason, and that they have no true or healthy aim.
23463 
23464 Exactly.
23465 
23466 The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has
23467 inferior offspring.
23468 
23469 Very true.
23470 
23471 And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing
23472 also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?
23473 
23474 Probably the same would be true of poetry.
23475 
23476 Do not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of
23477 painting; but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with
23478 which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.
23479 
23480 By all means.
23481 
23482 We may state the question thus:--Imitation imitates the actions of men,
23483 whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good or
23484 bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. Is there
23485 anything more?
23486 
23487 No, there is nothing else.
23488 
23489 But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with
23490 himself--or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and
23491 opposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there
23492 not strife and inconsistency in his life? Though I need hardly raise the
23493 question again, for I remember that all this has been already admitted;
23494 and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten
23495 thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?
23496 
23497 And we were right, he said.
23498 
23499 Yes, I said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission which
23500 must now be supplied.
23501 
23502 What was the omission?
23503 
23504 Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his
23505 son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with
23506 more equanimity than another?
23507 
23508 Yes.
23509 
23510 But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help
23511 sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?
23512 
23513 The latter, he said, is the truer statement.
23514 
23515 Tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his
23516 sorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?
23517 
23518 It will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.
23519 
23520 When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which
23521 he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?
23522 
23523 True.
23524 
23525 There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as
23526 well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his
23527 sorrow?
23528 
23529 True.
23530 
23531 But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same
23532 object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles
23533 in him?
23534 
23535 Certainly.
23536 
23537 One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?
23538 
23539 How do you mean?
23540 
23541 The law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that
23542 we should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether
23543 such things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience; also,
23544 because no human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands in the
23545 way of that which at the moment is most required.
23546 
23547 What is most required? he asked.
23548 
23549 That we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice
23550 have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best;
23551 not, like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck
23552 and wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul
23553 forthwith to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and fallen,
23554 banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.
23555 
23556 Yes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune.
23557 
23558 Yes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion
23559 of reason?
23560 
23561 Clearly.
23562 
23563 And the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our
23564 troubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may
23565 call irrational, useless, and cowardly?
23566 
23567 Indeed, we may.
23568 
23569 And does not the latter--I mean the rebellious principle--furnish a
23570 great variety of materials for imitation? Whereas the wise and calm
23571 temperament, being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or
23572 to appreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when a
23573 promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre. For the feeling represented
23574 is one to which they are strangers.
23575 
23576 Certainly.
23577 
23578 Then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made,
23579 nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the rational principle
23580 in the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which
23581 is easily imitated?
23582 
23583 Clearly.
23584 
23585 And now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter,
23586 for he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his creations have an
23587 inferior degree of truth--in this, I say, he is like him; and he is
23588 also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul; and
23589 therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well-ordered
23590 State, because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings
23591 and impairs the reason. As in a city when the evil are permitted to have
23592 authority and the good are put out of the way, so in the soul of man,
23593 as we maintain, the imitative poet implants an evil constitution, for he
23594 indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater
23595 and less, but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another
23596 small--he is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the
23597 truth.
23598 
23599 Exactly.
23600 
23601 But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our
23602 accusation:--the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and
23603 there are very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?
23604 
23605 Yes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.
23606 
23607 Hear and judge: The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a
23608 passage of Homer, or one of the tragedians, in which he represents
23609 some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration, or
23610 weeping, and smiting his breast--the best of us, you know, delight in
23611 giving way to sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of the
23612 poet who stirs our feelings most.
23613 
23614 Yes, of course I know.
23615 
23616 But when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe that
23617 we pride ourselves on the opposite quality--we would fain be quiet and
23618 patient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted us in the
23619 recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.
23620 
23621 Very true, he said.
23622 
23623 Now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that
23624 which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person?
23625 
23626 No, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.
23627 
23628 Nay, I said, quite reasonable from one point of view.
23629 
23630 What point of view?
23631 
23632 If you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural
23633 hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and
23634 that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is
23635 satisfied and delighted by the poets;--the better nature in each of
23636 us, not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the
23637 sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another's;
23638 and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in
23639 praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he
23640 is, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure
23641 is a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem
23642 too? Few persons ever reflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil
23643 of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves. And so
23644 the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the
23645 misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own.
23646 
23647 How very true!
23648 
23649 And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which
23650 you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or
23651 indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them,
23652 and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;--the case of pity
23653 is repeated;--there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to
23654 raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you
23655 were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and
23656 having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed
23657 unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.
23658 
23659 Quite true, he said.
23660 
23661 And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections,
23662 of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable
23663 from every action--in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions
23664 instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be
23665 controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue.
23666 
23667 I cannot deny it.
23668 
23669 Therefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists
23670 of Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas, and that he
23671 is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things, and
23672 that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and
23673 regulate your whole life according to him, we may love and honour those
23674 who say these things--they are excellent people, as far as their lights
23675 extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest
23676 of poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our
23677 conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only
23678 poetry which ought to be admitted into our State. For if you go beyond
23679 this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or lyric verse,
23680 not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent have ever
23681 been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our State.
23682 
23683 That is most true, he said.
23684 
23685 And now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our
23686 defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in
23687 sending away out of our State an art having the tendencies which we have
23688 described; for reason constrained us. But that she may not impute to us
23689 any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there is an
23690 ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry; of which there are many
23691 proofs, such as the saying of 'the yelping hound howling at her lord,'
23692 or of one 'mighty in the vain talk of fools,' and 'the mob of sages
23693 circumventing Zeus,' and the 'subtle thinkers who are beggars after
23694 all'; and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between
23695 them. Notwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet friend and the
23696 sister arts of imitation, that if she will only prove her title to exist
23697 in a well-ordered State we shall be delighted to receive her--we are
23698 very conscious of her charms; but we may not on that account betray the
23699 truth. I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as I am,
23700 especially when she appears in Homer?
23701 
23702 Yes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.
23703 
23704 Shall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but
23705 upon this condition only--that she make a defence of herself in lyrical
23706 or some other metre?
23707 
23708 Certainly.
23709 
23710 And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of
23711 poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf:
23712 let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States
23713 and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if this
23714 can be proved we shall surely be the gainers--I mean, if there is a use
23715 in poetry as well as a delight?
23716 
23717 Certainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.
23718 
23719 If her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who are
23720 enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they
23721 think their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we after
23722 the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle. We too
23723 are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble States
23724 has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at her best
23725 and truest; but so long as she is unable to make good her defence,
23726 this argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which we will repeat to
23727 ourselves while we listen to her strains; that we may not fall away into
23728 the childish love of her which captivates the many. At all events we
23729 are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to be
23730 regarded seriously as attaining to the truth; and he who listens to her,
23731 fearing for the safety of the city which is within him, should be on his
23732 guard against her seductions and make our words his law.
23733 
23734 Yes, he said, I quite agree with you.
23735 
23736 Yes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater
23737 than appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. And what will any one
23738 be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or
23739 under the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?
23740 
23741 Yes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe that
23742 any one else would have been.
23743 
23744 And yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards
23745 which await virtue.
23746 
23747 What, are there any greater still? If there are, they must be of an
23748 inconceivable greatness.
23749 
23750 Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time? The whole period of
23751 three score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison
23752 with eternity?
23753 
23754 Say rather 'nothing,' he replied.
23755 
23756 And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather
23757 than of the whole?
23758 
23759 Of the whole, certainly. But why do you ask?
23760 
23761 Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and
23762 imperishable?
23763 
23764 He looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are you
23765 really prepared to maintain this?
23766 
23767 Yes, I said, I ought to be, and you too--there is no difficulty in
23768 proving it.
23769 
23770 I see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this
23771 argument of which you make so light.
23772 
23773 Listen then.
23774 
23775 I am attending.
23776 
23777 There is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?
23778 
23779 Yes, he replied.
23780 
23781 Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying
23782 element is the evil, and the saving and improving element the good?
23783 
23784 Yes.
23785 
23786 And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as
23787 ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as
23788 mildew is of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in
23789 everything, or in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and
23790 disease?
23791 
23792 Yes, he said.
23793 
23794 And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and
23795 at last wholly dissolves and dies?
23796 
23797 True.
23798 
23799 The vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each;
23800 and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will; for
23801 good certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is neither
23802 good nor evil.
23803 
23804 Certainly not.
23805 
23806 If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption
23807 cannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a
23808 nature there is no destruction?
23809 
23810 That may be assumed.
23811 
23812 Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?
23813 
23814 Yes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing in
23815 review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.
23816 
23817 But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?--and here do not let us
23818 fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when
23819 he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil
23820 of the soul. Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a
23821 disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the
23822 things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through
23823 their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so
23824 destroying them. Is not this true?
23825 
23826 Yes.
23827 
23828 Consider the soul in like manner. Does the injustice or other evil which
23829 exists in the soul waste and consume her? Do they by attaching to the
23830 soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her
23831 from the body?
23832 
23833 Certainly not.
23834 
23835 And yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish
23836 from without through affection of external evil which could not be
23837 destroyed from within by a corruption of its own?
23838 
23839 It is, he replied.
23840 
23841 Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether
23842 staleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to
23843 the actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the
23844 badness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say
23845 that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is
23846 disease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be
23847 destroyed by the badness of food, which is another, and which does not
23848 engender any natural infection--this we shall absolutely deny?
23849 
23850 Very true.
23851 
23852 And, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil
23853 of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can
23854 be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?
23855 
23856 Yes, he said, there is reason in that.
23857 
23858 Either, then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains
23859 unrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the
23860 knife put to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into
23861 the minutest pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved
23862 to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things
23863 being done to the body; but that the soul, or anything else if not
23864 destroyed by an internal evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is
23865 not to be affirmed by any man.
23866 
23867 And surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of men
23868 become more unjust in consequence of death.
23869 
23870 But if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul
23871 boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more
23872 evil and unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that
23873 injustice, like disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and
23874 that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of
23875 destruction which evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but
23876 in quite another way from that in which, at present, the wicked receive
23877 death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds?
23878 
23879 Nay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will not
23880 be so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil. But I
23881 rather suspect the opposite to be the truth, and that injustice which,
23882 if it have the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer alive--aye,
23883 and well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place from being a
23884 house of death.
23885 
23886 True, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable
23887 to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to be the
23888 destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else except
23889 that of which it was appointed to be the destruction.
23890 
23891 Yes, that can hardly be.
23892 
23893 But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent
23894 or external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be
23895 immortal?
23896 
23897 Certainly.
23898 
23899 That is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then the
23900 souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not
23901 diminish in number. Neither will they increase, for the increase of the
23902 immortal natures must come from something mortal, and all things would
23903 thus end in immortality.
23904 
23905 Very true.
23906 
23907 But this we cannot believe--reason will not allow us--any more than we
23908 can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and
23909 difference and dissimilarity.
23910 
23911 What do you mean? he said.
23912 
23913 The soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest
23914 of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?
23915 
23916 Certainly not.
23917 
23918 Her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there are
23919 many other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we now behold
23920 her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you must
23921 contemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original purity; and
23922 then her beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all the
23923 things which we have described will be manifested more clearly. Thus
23924 far, we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present,
23925 but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition
23926 which may be compared to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original
23927 image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken
23928 off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways, and
23929 incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones, so
23930 that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form.
23931 And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition, disfigured by
23932 ten thousand ills. But not there, Glaucon, not there must we look.
23933 
23934 Where then?
23935 
23936 At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what society and
23937 converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal
23938 and eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly
23939 following this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of
23940 the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and shells
23941 and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her
23942 because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good things of
23943 this life as they are termed: then you would see her as she is, and know
23944 whether she have one shape only or many, or what her nature is. Of her
23945 affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life I think
23946 that we have now said enough.
23947 
23948 True, he replied.
23949 
23950 And thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument; we
23951 have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you
23952 were saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice in her own
23953 nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature. Let a
23954 man do what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges or not, and even
23955 if in addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the helmet of Hades.
23956 
23957 Very true.
23958 
23959 And now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how
23960 many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues
23961 procure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.
23962 
23963 Certainly not, he said.
23964 
23965 Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?
23966 
23967 What did I borrow?
23968 
23969 The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust
23970 just: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case
23971 could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission
23972 ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure
23973 justice might be weighed against pure injustice. Do you remember?
23974 
23975 I should be much to blame if I had forgotten.
23976 
23977 Then, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that the
23978 estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge
23979 to be her due should now be restored to her by us; since she has been
23980 shown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly possess her,
23981 let what has been taken from her be given back, that so she may win that
23982 palm of appearance which is hers also, and which she gives to her own.
23983 
23984 The demand, he said, is just.
23985 
23986 In the first place, I said--and this is the first thing which you will
23987 have to give back--the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known
23988 to the gods.
23989 
23990 Granted.
23991 
23992 And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the other
23993 the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?
23994 
23995 True.
23996 
23997 And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all
23998 things at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary
23999 consequence of former sins?
24000 
24001 Certainly.
24002 
24003 Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in
24004 poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will
24005 in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods
24006 have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like
24007 God, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of
24008 virtue?
24009 
24010 Yes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by him.
24011 
24012 And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?
24013 
24014 Certainly.
24015 
24016 Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?
24017 
24018 That is my conviction.
24019 
24020 And what do they receive of men? Look at things as they really are, and
24021 you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who run
24022 well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the
24023 goal: they go off at a great pace, but in the end only look foolish,
24024 slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without
24025 a crown; but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize
24026 and is crowned. And this is the way with the just; he who endures to the
24027 end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report
24028 and carries off the prize which men have to bestow.
24029 
24030 True.
24031 
24032 And now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you
24033 were attributing to the fortunate unjust. I shall say of them, what you
24034 were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become rulers
24035 in their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like and give
24036 in marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others I now say
24037 of these. And, on the other hand, of the unjust I say that the greater
24038 number, even though they escape in their youth, are found out at last
24039 and look foolish at the end of their course, and when they come to be
24040 old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen; they are
24041 beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite, as you truly
24042 term them; they will be racked and have their eyes burned out, as you
24043 were saying. And you may suppose that I have repeated the remainder of
24044 your tale of horrors. But will you let me assume, without reciting them,
24045 that these things are true?
24046 
24047 Certainly, he said, what you say is true.
24048 
24049 These, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed
24050 upon the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to the
24051 other good things which justice of herself provides.
24052 
24053 Yes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.
24054 
24055 And yet, I said, all these are as nothing either in number or greatness
24056 in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and
24057 unjust after death. And you ought to hear them, and then both just and
24058 unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the
24059 argument owes to them.
24060 
24061 Speak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly hear.
24062 
24063 Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which
24064 Odysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero,
24065 Er the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle,
24066 and ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up
24067 already in a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by
24068 decay, and carried away home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as he
24069 was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them what he
24070 had seen in the other world. He said that when his soul left the body
24071 he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came to a
24072 mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth; they
24073 were near together, and over against them were two other openings in the
24074 heaven above. In the intermediate space there were judges seated, who
24075 commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them and had bound
24076 their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the heavenly way on the
24077 right hand; and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend
24078 by the lower way on the left hand; these also bore the symbols of their
24079 deeds, but fastened on their backs. He drew near, and they told him that
24080 he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world
24081 to men, and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen
24082 in that place. Then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at
24083 either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them;
24084 and at the two other openings other souls, some ascending out of the
24085 earth dusty and worn with travel, some descending out of heaven clean
24086 and bright. And arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a
24087 long journey, and they went forth with gladness into the meadow, where
24088 they encamped as at a festival; and those who knew one another embraced
24089 and conversed, the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about
24090 the things above, and the souls which came from heaven about the things
24091 beneath. And they told one another of what had happened by the way,
24092 those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things
24093 which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth
24094 (now the journey lasted a thousand years), while those from above were
24095 describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty. The
24096 story, Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this:--He
24097 said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered
24098 tenfold; or once in a hundred years--such being reckoned to be the
24099 length of man's life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a
24100 thousand years. If, for example, there were any who had been the cause
24101 of many deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been
24102 guilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences
24103 they received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence
24104 and justice and holiness were in the same proportion. I need hardly
24105 repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon
24106 as they were born. Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of
24107 murderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he
24108 described. He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits
24109 asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?' (Now this Ardiaeus lived
24110 a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of
24111 some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder
24112 brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)
24113 The answer of the other spirit was: 'He comes not hither and will never
24114 come. And this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful sights which we
24115 ourselves witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having
24116 completed all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden
24117 Ardiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and
24118 there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been
24119 great criminals: they were just, as they fancied, about to return into
24120 the upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar,
24121 whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been
24122 sufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men of fiery
24123 aspect, who were standing by and heard the sound, seized and carried
24124 them off; and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand, and
24125 threw them down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them along
24126 the road at the side, carding them on thorns like wool, and declaring
24127 to the passers-by what were their crimes, and that they were being taken
24128 away to be cast into hell.' And of all the many terrors which they had
24129 endured, he said that there was none like the terror which each of them
24130 felt at that moment, lest they should hear the voice; and when there was
24131 silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding joy. These, said Er,
24132 were the penalties and retributions, and there were blessings as great.
24133 
24134 Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days,
24135 on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on the
24136 fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could
24137 see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right
24138 through the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the
24139 rainbow, only brighter and purer; another day's journey brought them to
24140 the place, and there, in the midst of the light, they saw the ends of
24141 the chains of heaven let down from above: for this light is the belt
24142 of heaven, and holds together the circle of the universe, like the
24143 under-girders of a trireme. From these ends is extended the spindle of
24144 Necessity, on which all the revolutions turn. The shaft and hook of this
24145 spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is made partly of steel and
24146 also partly of other materials. Now the whorl is in form like the whorl
24147 used on earth; and the description of it implied that there is one large
24148 hollow whorl which is quite scooped out, and into this is fitted another
24149 lesser one, and another, and another, and four others, making eight
24150 in all, like vessels which fit into one another; the whorls show their
24151 edges on the upper side, and on their lower side all together form one
24152 continuous whorl. This is pierced by the spindle, which is driven home
24153 through the centre of the eighth. The first and outermost whorl has the
24154 rim broadest, and the seven inner whorls are narrower, in the following
24155 proportions--the sixth is next to the first in size, the fourth next
24156 to the sixth; then comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth
24157 is sixth, the third is seventh, last and eighth comes the second.
24158 The largest (or fixed stars) is spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is
24159 brightest; the eighth (or moon) coloured by the reflected light of the
24160 seventh; the second and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) are in colour like
24161 one another, and yellower than the preceding; the third (Venus) has the
24162 whitest light; the fourth (Mars) is reddish; the sixth (Jupiter) is in
24163 whiteness second. Now the whole spindle has the same motion; but, as the
24164 whole revolves in one direction, the seven inner circles move slowly in
24165 the other, and of these the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness
24166 are the seventh, sixth, and fifth, which move together; third in
24167 swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion
24168 the fourth; the third appeared fourth and the second fifth. The spindle
24169 turns on the knees of Necessity; and on the upper surface of each circle
24170 is a siren, who goes round with them, hymning a single tone or note. The
24171 eight together form one harmony; and round about, at equal intervals,
24172 there is another band, three in number, each sitting upon her throne:
24173 these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, who are clothed in white
24174 robes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis and Clotho
24175 and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of the
24176 sirens--Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos of
24177 the future; Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right
24178 hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and
24179 Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones, and
24180 Lachesis laying hold of either in turn, first with one hand and then
24181 with the other.
24182 
24183 When Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to
24184 Lachesis; but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in
24185 order; then he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of
24186 lives, and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'Hear the
24187 word of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new
24188 cycle of life and mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you,
24189 but you will choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot
24190 have the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his
24191 destiny. Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will
24192 have more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser--God
24193 is justified.' When the Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots
24194 indifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which
24195 fell near him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed), and each as
24196 he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained. Then the
24197 Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives; and
24198 there were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of all
24199 sorts. There were lives of every animal and of man in every condition.
24200 And there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant's life,
24201 others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and
24202 exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some who were
24203 famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and
24204 success in games, or, again, for their birth and the qualities of their
24205 ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite
24206 qualities. And of women likewise; there was not, however, any definite
24207 character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new life, must of
24208 necessity become different. But there was every other quality, and
24209 the all mingled with one another, and also with elements of wealth and
24210 poverty, and disease and health; and there were mean states also. And
24211 here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme peril of our human state; and
24212 therefore the utmost care should be taken. Let each one of us leave
24213 every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only, if
24214 peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make
24215 him able to learn and discern between good and evil, and so to choose
24216 always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. He should
24217 consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned
24218 severally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what the effect
24219 of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul,
24220 and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth,
24221 of private and public station, of strength and weakness, of cleverness
24222 and dullness, and of all the natural and acquired gifts of the soul, and
24223 the operation of them when conjoined; he will then look at the nature of
24224 the soul, and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be
24225 able to determine which is the better and which is the worse; and so
24226 he will choose, giving the name of evil to the life which will make his
24227 soul more unjust, and good to the life which will make his soul more
24228 just; all else he will disregard. For we have seen and know that this is
24229 the best choice both in life and after death. A man must take with him
24230 into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right, that there
24231 too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements
24232 of evil, lest, coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies, he do
24233 irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself; but let him
24234 know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as
24235 far as possible, not only in this life but in all that which is to come.
24236 For this is the way of happiness.
24237 
24238 And according to the report of the messenger from the other world this
24239 was what the prophet said at the time: 'Even for the last comer, if he
24240 chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and
24241 not undesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first be careless,
24242 and let not the last despair.' And when he had spoken, he who had the
24243 first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny;
24244 his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not
24245 thought out the whole matter before he chose, and did not at first
24246 sight perceive that he was fated, among other evils, to devour his own
24247 children. But when he had time to reflect, and saw what was in the lot,
24248 he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, forgetting the
24249 proclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing the blame of his
24250 misfortune on himself, he accused chance and the gods, and everything
24251 rather than himself. Now he was one of those who came from heaven, and
24252 in a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered State, but his virtue was
24253 a matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy. And it was true of
24254 others who were similarly overtaken, that the greater number of them
24255 came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial,
24256 whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and
24257 seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to choose. And owing to this
24258 inexperience of theirs, and also because the lot was a chance, many of
24259 the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good.
24260 For if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself
24261 from the first to sound philosophy, and had been moderately fortunate
24262 in the number of the lot, he might, as the messenger reported, be happy
24263 here, and also his journey to another life and return to this, instead
24264 of being rough and underground, would be smooth and heavenly. Most
24265 curious, he said, was the spectacle--sad and laughable and strange; for
24266 the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of
24267 a previous life. There he saw the soul which had once been Orpheus
24268 choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women, hating
24269 to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers; he beheld
24270 also the soul of Thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale; birds, on
24271 the other hand, like the swan and other musicians, wanting to be men.
24272 The soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and
24273 this was the soul of Ajax the son of Telamon, who would not be a man,
24274 remembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the
24275 arms. The next was Agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because,
24276 like Ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings. About
24277 the middle came the lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of
24278 an athlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after her there
24279 followed the soul of Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature
24280 of a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who chose,
24281 the soul of the jester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey.
24282 There came also the soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and
24283 his lot happened to be the last of them all. Now the recollection of
24284 former toils had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for
24285 a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no
24286 cares; he had some difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and
24287 had been neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that
24288 he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of last,
24289 and that he was delighted to have it. And not only did men pass into
24290 animals, but I must also mention that there were animals tame and wild
24291 who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures--the
24292 good into the gentle and the evil into the savage, in all sorts of
24293 combinations.
24294 
24295 All the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the order of
24296 their choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had
24297 severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller
24298 of the choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew
24299 them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus
24300 ratifying the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to
24301 this, carried them to Atropos, who spun the threads and made them
24302 irreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the
24303 throne of Necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on in a
24304 scorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness, which was a barren waste
24305 destitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they encamped
24306 by the river of Unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can hold; of this
24307 they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity, and those who were
24308 not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he
24309 drank forgot all things. Now after they had gone to rest, about the
24310 middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake, and then
24311 in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their
24312 birth, like stars shooting. He himself was hindered from drinking the
24313 water. But in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he
24314 could not say; only, in the morning, awaking suddenly, he found himself
24315 lying on the pyre.
24316 
24317 And thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, and
24318 will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass
24319 safely over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled.
24320 Wherefore my counsel is, that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and
24321 follow after justice and virtue always, considering that the soul is
24322 immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil.
24323 Thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods, both while
24324 remaining here and when, like conquerors in the games who go round to
24325 gather gifts, we receive our reward. And it shall be well with us both
24326 in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have
24327 been describing.

24346 Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

24349 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
24350 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
24351 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
24352 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
24353 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
24354 charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
24355 do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
24356 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
24357 such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
24358 research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
24359 practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

24367 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
24368 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
24369 
24370 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
24371 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
24372 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
24373 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
24374 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
24375 http://gutenberg.org/license).
24376 
24377 
24378 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
24379 electronic works
24380 
24381 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
24382 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
24383 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
24384 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
24385 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
24386 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
24387 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
24388 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
24389 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
24390 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
24391 
24392 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
24393 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
24394 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
24395 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
24396 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
24397 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
24398 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
24399 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
24400 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
24401 
24402 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
24403 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
24404 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
24405 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
24406 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
24407 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
24408 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
24409 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
24410 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
24411 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
24412 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
24413 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
24414 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
24415 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
24416 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
24417 
24418 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
24419 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
24420 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
24421 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
24422 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
24423 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
24424 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
24425 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
24426 States.
24427 
24428 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
24429 
24430 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
24431 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
24432 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
24433 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
24434 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
24435 copied or distributed:
24436 
24437 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
24438 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
24439 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
24440 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
24441 
24442 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
24443 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
24444 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
24445 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
24446 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
24447 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
24448 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
24449 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
24450 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
24451 1.E.9.
24452 
24453 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
24454 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
24455 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
24456 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
24457 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
24458 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
24459 
24460 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
24461 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
24462 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
24463 
24464 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
24465 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
24466 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
24467 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
24468 Gutenberg-tm License.
24469 
24470 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
24471 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
24472 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
24473 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
24474 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
24475 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
24476 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
24477 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
24478 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
24479 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
24480 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
24481 
24482 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
24483 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
24484 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
24485 
24486 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
24487 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
24488 that
24489 
24490 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
24491      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
24492      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
24493      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
24494      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
24495      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
24496      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
24497      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
24498      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
24499      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
24500      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
24501      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
24502 
24503 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
24504      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
24505      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
24506      License.  You must require such a user to return or
24507      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
24508      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
24509      Project Gutenberg-tm works.
24510 
24511 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
24512      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
24513      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
24514      of receipt of the work.
24515 
24516 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
24517      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
24518 
24519 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
24520 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
24521 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
24522 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
24523 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
24524 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
24525 
24526 1.F.
24527 
24528 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
24529 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
24530 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
24531 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
24532 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
24533 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
24534 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
24535 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
24536 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
24537 your equipment.
24538 
24539 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
24540 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
24541 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
24542 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
24543 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
24544 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
24545 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
24546 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
24547 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
24548 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
24549 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
24550 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
24551 DAMAGE.
24552 
24553 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
24554 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
24555 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
24556 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
24557 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
24558 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
24559 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
24560 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
24561 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
24562 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
24563 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
24564 opportunities to fix the problem.
24565 
24566 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
24567 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
24568 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
24569 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
24570 
24571 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
24572 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
24573 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
24574 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
24575 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
24576 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
24577 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
24578 
24579 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
24580 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
24581 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
24582 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
24583 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
24584 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
24585 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
24586 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
24587 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
24588 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
24589 
24590 
24591 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
24592 
24593 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
24594 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
24595 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
24596 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
24597 people in all walks of life.
24598 
24599 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
24600 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
24601 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
24602 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
24603 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
24604 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
24605 To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
24606 and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

24613 The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
24614 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
24615 state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
24616 Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

24636 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
24637 Literary Archive Foundation
24638 
24639 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
24640 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
24641 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
24642 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
24643 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
24644 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
24645 status with the IRS.
24646 
24647 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
24648 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
24649 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
24650 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
24651 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
24652 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
24653 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
24654 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
24655 
24656 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
24657 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
24658 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
24659 approach us with offers to donate.
24660 
24661 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
24662 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
24663 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
24664 
24665 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
24666 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
24667 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

24671 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
24672 works.
24673 
24674 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
24675 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
24676 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
24677 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
24678 
24679 
24680 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
24681 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
24682 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
24683 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
24684 
24685 
24686 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
24687 
24688      http://www.gutenberg.org
24689 
24690 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
24691 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
24692 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
24693 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
