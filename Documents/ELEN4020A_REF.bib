Note that, because the example references were taken from actual IEEE
publications, these examples do not always contain the full amount
of information that may be desirable (for use with other BibTeX styles).
In particular, full names (not abbreviated with initials) should be
entered whenever possible as some (non-IEEE) bibliography styles use
full names. IEEEtran.bst will automatically abbreviate when it encounters
full names.
